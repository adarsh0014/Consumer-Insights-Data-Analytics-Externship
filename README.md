# Consumer-Insights-Data-Analytics-Externship
This repository features my work from the Consumer Insights Data Analytics Externship by Beats by Dre. It includes data preprocessing, EDA, advanced visualizations, and sentiment analysis using NLTK and TextBlob. The project highlights skills in data wrangling, text analysis, and deriving actionable insights to understand consumer behavior.
