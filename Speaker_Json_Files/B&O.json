Very portable. Great connectivity.I also have the Beoplay A1 (1st generation. Very important). The A1 does have the bass, but not the battery life. And the connectivity of the A1 is tricky.

It doesn't have any bass to speak of, but it does have richly textured lower midtones (which I'd say are more important), and sparkling treble notes. My wife also loves it. If I was hosting barbecues, and inviting company over, it would not be nearly big enough. For parties I'd get the larger model B&O portable. But I just put this little thing on the patio table with the wine and snacks, and its perfect for myself and my wife. Battery life seems to be very good.

Normally their gear is priced out of the range of normal-average-hard-working folk ($10000 speakers for example), but with this product, you can get to experience a slice of the life of the upper 0.1%!In all seriousness, this is a regular tiny Bluetooth speaker which has a price at least 5X more than your average tiny Bluetooth speaker. So what do you get for that premium? First, the whole shell is made of metal. It feels cool to the touch. It has hard ‚ÄúType II anodization‚Äù on the aluminum shell which will help resist scratches, and should take the hard knocks while it‚Äôs hanging off your backpack using the supplied carabiner clip. The speaker is IPX67 meaning it‚Äôs water and dust resistant. You can immerse the whole thing into water for a very short period even.Soundwise, this is a tiny speaker so don‚Äôt expect much in terms of volume and thump. It will start to distort if you try to turn it up too high (it's not going to fill a large room in your house). It sounds smooth and the tonality is slightly warm (you hear less of the treble and more of the midrange). Deep bass is nonexistent, but there‚Äôs just enough of upper bass tones that you can follow the rhythm of the beat. Measurements on other review sites show that it doesn‚Äôt reproduce any content below 100Hz. Basically, it doesn‚Äôt reinvent any laws of acoustics and still sounds like a small speaker. But the overall sound quality is clean and the tonality is pleasant. it‚Äôs a portable speaker that you can carry with you anywhere, so you can have some music while boating, at the beach, hiking, camping etc. It just works!Battery life is good, at lower and moderate volumes, it easily lasts 10+ hours. Controls are simple: power, volume, play/pause/skip forward backwards. It isn‚Äôt necessary to install the app but the app is useful because it gives you the exact battery percentage, turn-off the auto-standby feature if you don‚Äôt want it, and has some presets to select a different sound signature or alternatively you can fine tune the strength of the treble/midrange/bass precisely by moving around a slider into four quadrants on the screen. I think it sounds fine with the default ‚Äúoptimized‚Äù preset. Also as a bonus, you can plug this into your computer with the USB and used it like a wired USB speaker. You can pair two Bluetooth devices to it, which is the norm nowadays.So is it worth it? By the way, I bought this at a 45% discount (check amazon price history for this product) and even though it‚Äôs still not inexpensive, I feel it is good value. Even if it had cost more, I would not have been disappointed. I don‚Äôt mind paying more for something that feels like it‚Äôs going to last, and with B&O, you get some cutting edge design with great sound engineering.This is a 5 star product, but minus 1 star just because I would have liked to have a microphone so that it acts as speakerphone. Also, because of the bluetooth profile, your device won't show the battery percentage on the phone itself, you have to view the percentage in the app. And the sound is good but it doesn't manage to break any laws of physics (not blaming the speaker but I had hoped that it would really stand out among other small speakers of this size with the bag of tricks that B&O geniuses have up their sleeves. The result is merely very good rather than exceptional). So result is 4 out of 5","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States March 3, 2024","profile_id":"AE6TVTGGPRUEMJMSIV5SX6NDA2PA","is_verified":true,"helpful_count":7,"product_attributes":"Color: NavyStyle: Bluetooth speaker"},{"id":"R2X7LV4K100RNI","title":"5.0 out of 5 stars Natural true sounding speaker.","author":"hubbabubba66","rating":5,"content":"Sound quality is very good.

The IOS/Android app is very weak but once it's set up you don't need to use it again. Note, this is not a party speaker.

UE boom, UE roll (both good for the money). I have a Harmon kardon gen 1 or 2 Bluetooth that sounds excellent. I have an Audi A 5 convertible with a B and O sound system that is just the best thing ever. I had never heard B and O until I got the Audi. So. Now I have refurbished a vintage travel trailer and wanted some killer sound while I‚Äôm camping. It‚Äôs a small space so I don‚Äôt need anything like the Harmon Kardon. Plus that needs an outlet. So I‚Äôm thinking what does B and O offer in a small package? I got this speaker for $118 because of the gray color I guess. It was cheaper than black. I downloaded the app. And with some adjustments to the bass /treble on the app I was able to get a satisfactory sound. Was I blown away. Sadly not. I was expecting a lot more from B and O. Even if it‚Äôs just a wireless speaker. It‚Äôs not bad by any means. And I guess for the price it‚Äôs a good value. I guess I‚Äôm comparing it to my Audi stereo system which is just amazing. ü§© I can crank it to infinity and it‚Äôs crystal clear. I like crisp sound that I can distinctly hear all the beautiful components. Is that too much to ask for in a wireless Bluetooth speaker from the infamous B and O? Like l said it‚Äôs not bad any means. But I guess my expectations were too high. It can be cranked to a point. But I‚Äôd like it louder. Anyway. Just my rambling thoughts. I‚Äôm in my little camper now drinking some beer on a sunny Saturday afternoon listening to some jazz and just chillin.

A Bluetooth that last all day and overcomes the sound of a loud diesel tractor is very important to me not losing my mind.Bang & Olufsen is pretty well the gold standard in audio as far as I‚Äôm concerned. My BMW has it and it‚Äôs the best audio of any car I‚Äôve ever had. This Bluetooth speaker follows that tradition.The design is incredibly compact, elegant and well thought out. The ability to hang it with a carabiner was an incredibly important consideration for me. It‚Äôs a beautiful piece of engineering.Performance is exceptional when used with the app which allows fine tuning. It‚Äôs incredibly loud, fills a space and has rich audio. Do not care about bass as you won‚Äôt get meaningful bass out of a small speaker for the most part. Clear audio is the name of the game and this speaker breaks so many rules. It pushes way above its weight class.Not to mention it‚Äôs entirely inexpensive for the performance this bad boy delivers.

As an avid audiophile with a penchant for high-end audio equipment, I was excited to add this to my collection. The build quality is exceptional, a true testament to the craftsmanship that went into its design. However, when it comes to the volume, I can't help but feel a sense of disappointment. The sound it produces, while undoubtedly of high quality, is a bit subdued for my taste. As someone who values the intricacies and nuances of audio, I expected more power and presence. While I appreciate the materials and construction, the volume, and the bass issue leaves me wanting more. While I understand the need for portability, the subdued volume simply doesn't cut it for me. Music should have the power to fill a space, to move people, and to evoke emotions, and this speaker falls short in that department. It's crucial for me to have a device that can truly capture the essence of my music, and unfortunately, this one falls short in that regard for those reasons I have to give it 4 stars instead of 5 stars.","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States October 13, 2023","profile_id":"AFUJHHCQZAAFBM6YYCAIOHJOIIBA","is_verified":true,"helpful_count":10,"product_attributes":"Color: Black AnthraciteStyle: Bluetooth speaker"},{"id":"RHPQDXVXOSAEN","title":"5.0 out of 5 stars Classy and durable","author":"Tiana","rating":5,"content":"Love the speaker.

I currently have a 3rd generation Oontz Angle 3 Ultra that‚Äôs I‚Äôve had for 6 years and was in need of replacing ‚Äì not because it was worn out, but I just wanted something newer and nicer but generally the same size with more power/more clarity. The B&O explore caught my attention right away due to the design and name. The price seemed a bit eye-watering, but I was really attracted to the battery life (a must for me), the design (very modern and durable), and the fact that is wasn‚Äôt a ‚Äòsmart speak‚Äô. I purchased the speaker, and downloaded the B&O app. The app is a MUST if you want ANY bass projection at all. Everything about this speaker is perfect for me‚Ä¶..except for the bass. There just isn‚Äôt any bass! Even with the app settings set to product as much bass as possible, the Explore just can‚Äôt deliver. Ultimately, this is a disappointment, as the price tag just doesn‚Äôt justify the sounds quality. All B&O need to do is add a little more bass for a perfect ‚Äì if expensive ‚Äì speaker! A it stands the JBL Flip 6 is the perfect speaker in this category and is only about $100 ‚Äì so half the price of the B&O Explore. Here hoping B&O will make a Explore 2.0 with more bass, but will retain everything else that makes this speaker so cool.","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States June 5, 2023","profile_id":"AHQTQTOQV5PGD55DUMHONIDGOHCQ","is_verified":true,"helpful_count":19,"product_attributes":"Color: NavyStyle: Bluetooth speaker"},{"id":"R1DPI5KKT6Q3PF","title":"4.0 out of 5 stars Have to use the App before using.","author":"M.

Unfortunately, because I thought this would be a great product because this a well respected brand, I threw out the box it came in, otherwise I would have returned it. There is absolutely no bass, it's not that loud, the app is glitchy and won't change the equalizer. If you want to spend the a little less money and get a really good product, get a Harmon / Kardon Luna for $100 less. Or a Soundcore Motion X600 for $50 less. Those things sound a million times better. One that surprised me was the UE Wonder Boom 4 for only $100, and it's a similar size with twice the max volume and way better sound. Severely disappointed.

I got it on sale. The price for this speaker I feel is worth every penny. The speaker does have weight to it. Not too heavy but because it is made out of quality metal it adds weight compared to cheap plastic ones. However that weight provides better sound since there is no rattling like plastic speakers. It‚Äôs a great size and looks amazing wherever you put it. It performs great in small rooms but in large rooms if you put it towards the center of the room it really fills the room. The sound is incredible for something so small. The quality of the sound doesn‚Äôt change as you turn it even all the way up. I was really impressed at what a clean sound it has. I do move it from room to room and bought it primarily for around the house but have also used it outside and taken it with me. Because it‚Äôs metal and looks so good and I want to keep it that way when putting it in a bag I put it in a small case type bag. However I haven‚Äôt been overly careful sign it around the house and even dropped it and nothing happened to it. The strap is well made also and really convenient and looks good because it‚Äôs well made as well.

(‚Ä¶for a year‚Ä¶)","author":"alrightalrightalright","rating":2,"content":"I‚Äôm super picky about my Bluetooth speakers. I used to have a wonderboom and was happy with it until it finally croaked. I wanted something with long battery life, that was waterproof and decently rugged, and that had good sound quality. I initially bought another wonderboom but hated it! I did tons of research because I needed to replace it with something. I bring my little speaker everywhere and use it all the time. I‚Äôm so glad I gave this a shot. It‚Äôs perfect for my needs. I expected good sound quality, but I think that the sound quality on the Beosound Explore is *great* when you consider where it‚Äôs coming from. Everything is super balanced, and the app is useful if you want to do a bit of ‚Äúfine tuning‚Äù to the EQ. It charges via USB-C. And I love that it comes with a little strap and carabiner. I use that all the time, actually, and it‚Äôs super convenient. The design and craftsmanship on the whole is stunning, and something I really appreciate. I feel like the machined aluminum casing probably lends to the sound quality this little thing can produce, but I‚Äôm not a sound engineer so this is just speculation. I got this for a steal of a deal on prime day - I think I paid like $130. For that price, I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything better. If this speaker had a microphone, I think that would take it to the next level and make it worthy of some extra cash, but it‚Äôs not something I really need. My only two gripes are the design of the top - it collects water since there is a lip around the edge. The other is that it did sound a little ‚Äútinny‚Äù once when I probably turned the volume up way too much on one particular song - by way too much, I mean all the way up, like 100%. So unless you frequently do that, you‚Äôll probably never experience it.Update 1 year and 2 months later - the speaker has started failing. It is distorting whatever audio I try to play. I have not done anything crazy with this - it‚Äôs never been dropped or exposed to any really extreme environments. Super upset as now I need to find a new portable Bluetooth speaker, and I won‚Äôt be going with B&O this time :(","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States January 6, 2023","profile_id":"AG2NJCF7CFJ5FYZFKXRSFHKZR5JA","is_verified":true,"helpful_count":24,"product_attributes":"Color: Grey MistStyle: Bluetooth speaker"}],"page_type":"Question","asin_in_url":"B08YRT9T38","product_name":"Bang & Olufsen Beosound Explore - Wireless Portable Outdoor Bluetooth speaker, IP 67 Dustproof and Waterproof, Anthracite","parse_status_code":12000},"created_at":"2024-09-08 14:11:03","updated_at":"2024-09-08 14:11:09","page":3,"url":"https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B08YRT9T38?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=3","job_id":"7238549404662107137","is_render_forced":false,"status_code":200,"parser_type":""},{"content":{"url":"https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B08YRT9T38?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=4","asin":"B08YRT9T38","page":4,"pages":75,"reviews":[{"id":"R1UUG9B701YHBM","title":"5.0 out of 5 stars Pure Crisp Sound","author":"Antonio","rating":5,"content":"I just got my B&O explore speakers today.

I mainly listen to classical music and popular music.I pick Explore because it has the ability to present the music I love in a very good and pleasant way.Sound quality:Bose‚Äôs sound is nice, but it is too emphasized on bass that the music became incorrect. Sonos‚Äô Roam is a close runner-up, but it‚Äôs sound is too soft in the bass and too puncture in the middle. Emberton is great for the popular music but for classical music, some wind instruments sound a bit wrong. The A1 from B&Q is surprisingly a bit spread out that the focus went too far. Explore is a small speaker that has the fault of closed up sound that every small speaker has, but it shows the ability to produce a pleasant balance that I love.Functions:The last thing I want is they recording my shower singing in those Alexa/Siri enable smart speaker, so this speaker is best for privacy concerns.I recommend you download the app and play around to find the sound you like!

First bear in mind that not all speakers are for everyone. Speakers are like clothes, perfumes, etc. You choose them according to your tastes but in order to buy the right one (speakers) first you you need to ask yourself a couple of questions. What kind of music do I listen to? What kind of brand do I relate with? What am I expecting of it? This portable speaker doesn‚Äôt really have deep bass, TRUE, but it is there. Apart from that, the voicing of it is great. The vocals sound clear and warm and its ability of playing a song with lots of sounds and instruments is great for such a small portable speaker.I own many portable speakers including the Bose revolve+ and I prefer the Explore in most of the cases. Again, if you want a speaker for extreme bass music, this is not the one, but if you like Vocal music, smooth Jazz like Diana Krall you are going to love it.If you want a party speaker this is not the one either, but if you want a speaker that accompanies you during your walks or have it with you in your office or home without stealing all your attention this is the one for you because although this little speaker can get loud it does it with class and without being obnoxious.

Initially, I was impressed by its aesthetics. However, my experience quickly soured as the battery stopped working, making it the fifth quality problem I've encountered with a product from this brand.In all honesty, I found this Bang & Olufsen speaker to be disappointing. The brand's reputation suggests top-tier products, but this speaker left much to be desired. The fact that this is my fifth quality problem with a Bang & Olufsen product strongly suggests a recurring issue with their quality control and reliability.While the designs and external materials are undeniably cool and visually appealing, it's clear that the internal components don't match up. When it comes to speakers, the sound quality is paramount, and in this aspect, I was underwhelmed. The claim that older products from competitors like Bose, Marshall, JBL, and Sony perform better and offer superior sound quality even with cheaper exterior materials holds weight based on my experience.In conclusion, I would caution potential buyers to think twice before investing in expensive products from the Bang & Olufsen brand. While they excel in aesthetics, the quality and performance of their speakers may not meet your expectations, and the fact that this is my fifth quality problem with their products suggests a larger issue within the brand. There are more reliable alternatives available in the market.","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States October 25, 2023","profile_id":"AGR7LJUYQZ5HEIV24E6S6WXHSUTQ","is_verified":true,"helpful_count":12,"product_attributes":"Color: GreenStyle: Bluetooth speaker"},{"id":"R28Z1H9J1I5WJM","title":"5.0 out of 5 stars Great Sound !!","author":"Gina S.","rating":5,"content":"Contemporary is looks and has a nice equalizer built into the app to manipulate your preferences in sound output.","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States December 27, 2023","profile_id":"AFIQ56CPM52MRGK2KSIIABJVZXSQ","is_verified":true,"helpful_count":1,"product_attributes":"Color: Grey MistStyle: Bluetooth speaker"},{"id":"R3B0BIJWDBFSVU","title":"5.0 out of 5 stars great little piece, powerful enough","author":"Customer","rating":5,"content":"Love it, connects with no issues and is powerful enough","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States January 30, 2024","profile_id":"AFYCO7UFI2MIMRHG27G7Z2XGQSLQ","is_verified":true,"helpful_count":1,"product_attributes":"Color: Grey MistStyle: Bluetooth speaker"},{"id":"R2S5AGAPHU0SY4","title":"3.0 out of 5 stars No low frequencies","author":"P.
