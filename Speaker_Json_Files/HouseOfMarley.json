Barnhouse","rating":5,"content":"I wanted a bookshelf speaker for a bedroom, and I'm glad I found this.The size works for me, as does the ported speaker design, as it sits on a shelf with enough room at the back and sides to allow the sound to radiate.The audio is crisp, clear, and well balanced. Bass is smooth and solid, highs are bright and tight. Nice instrumental and vocal definition, and nicely audible stereo separation. This generates plenty of volume for small- to mid-size rooms, more than I need for the place where I use it.It pairs with my iphone quickly and reliably. Volume control from the phone works as it should. I tend to set the phone around mid-level and then use the speaker control to amp it up.What a nice design - old-school genuine wood, fabric, speakers on display, and nothing more. No flashing lights or gimmicks. Simple basic controls.I've been listening and tinkering with audiophile equipment for my whole life. I find this system to be real bargain for the price in today's world of junky plastic techno-boxes. Props to Marley for offering up a fine alternative.","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States April 4, 2024","profile_id":"AHB5ALPDVWLRBUCFCYE7XSBUJSOA","is_verified":true,"helpful_count":4,"product_attributes":"Color: Signature Black"},{"id":"R14VQ76J2BBPZW","title":"5.0 out of 5 stars Quality Appearance","author":"Waynell","rating":5,"content":"Good sound, very sturdy and charged quickly.

I‚Äôve also read pretty much every review on here, so I‚Äôll touch on some of the more frequent concerns.Sound quality: 1/5 very flat sounding with almost no bass and lackluster mids. Generally makes your music sound dull and lifeless. It does get fairly loud if you need it to, though. Acoustic music sounds alright, but that‚Äôs about it...Connections: 5/5 I‚Äôve had no issues with the Bluetooth or aux port on this. Never drops or cuts out from my apple or android devices. Sounds like QC is a bit problematic though, as lots of people have had issues in this department.Portability: 2/5 No covers for the speakers always makes me nervous when taking this anywhere. Just waiting for the day I get a pen through it or something. Battery adds a point though, because it has been reliable and lasts as long as advertised.Build: 4/5 Everything looks like it was put together well. Materials are nice. Good weight to it.Other: I am constantly annoyed that this doesn‚Äôt have a remote. I just want to turn it on and pair without getting up...","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States January 13, 2018","profile_id":"AFYB3LGAEKCS6ASTYBQFRKOTMAGQ","is_verified":true,"helpful_count":5,"product_attributes":"Color: Signature Black"},{"id":"R3JQPPX1Y95OK6","title":"5.0 out of 5 stars Speakers","author":"Gerald Lewis","rating":5,"content":"A great value for the money, great sound, üëç I wish they had put a charger with it I has to wait a few days because I didn't have a charger, they should just add the price with the speaker","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States April 6, 2024","profile_id":"AHTLZR4RXXXKEVSL7PX7M3LB67FQ","is_verified":true,"helpful_count":1,"product_attributes":"Color: Signature Black"},{"id":"R37N9CRZH4HT03","title":"3.0 out of 5 stars Bluetooth fails with Pixel 6 A","author":"Green Mountain Boy","rating":3,"content":"I did not like fact that customer support thought I was an idiot because the Bluetooth they have doesn't work properly for Pixel 6A.

This was a mistake, and I am quite disappointed. Except for its look and styling, which I like very much (except for the exceptionally large and bulky size and weight, which I don't), there is nothing else that I like about this speaker:Sound quality - very tinny, almost unpleasant. I often listen to podcasts, and the default sound quality borders on unlistenable. I have to manipulate the equalizer settings on my phone app to be able to listen, and I have to do this every time. Very annoying. The situation is only slightly better when listening to music. Even my little first-generation Oontz Angle sounds better! In fact, my experience is at such odds with the reviews, that I wonder if I have a defective product.Size: I knew when I ordered that this was a larger system than most others in its quality and price range, but I guess I should have looked more closely at the dimensions, which are, for a \"portable\" system, huge and heavy. Maybe some people like this - not me. Much too big, much too heavy.Battery life - haven't measured it, but it is MUCH shorter than any other portable bluetooth speaker I have owned, and this was true right out of the box.Connection and operation: it works okay, but is annoyingly non-intuitive.Conclusion: poor sound quality, too big, short battery life, non-intuitive operation. There dozens of alternatives that will give you much better quality and satisfaction, for a lot less money. Stay away from the House of Marley, at least this particular product.","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States April 30, 2018","profile_id":"AEJUHFEP7FRKBCAMWYULJID43ITA","is_verified":true,"helpful_count":3,"product_attributes":"Color: Signature Black"},{"id":"RY8XYJWYJ2Y94","title":"1.0 out of 5 stars It would not charge.","author":"Laurie Alexander","rating":1,"content":"I will not charge.

Five minutes of silence is all...don't get too comfortable, or take too much time to decide on what you want to listen to...five minutes....quick before it turns off...really annoying.

We saw this cool speaker, and both looked at each other and basically said, \"no way all this sound is coming from only this speaker!?\" And it was. I ordered one the next day. It's great, connects to BT on iPhone right away, range is on par with most better BT products, 30' +/-. Audio is very good for what it is, definitely above average. I also have a little Yamaha BT speaker (don't recall what model) and the Marley blows it away. I have heard some from JBL that sound good, the Marley is better.
