Quality, volume, battery, and features make this THE BEST!","author":"Jeremy","rating":5,"content":"The JBL Charge 5 is the BEST speaker I have ever owned. I have had the average run-of-the-mill bluetooth speaker that has around a $20 value, for over a year, and I thought it was good sound quality, and I never thought I needed something “fancy.” Well, that speaker started having problems, and I was carefully searching for another speaker. I found this speaker and I thought I would try something new. I only had one thought as I played music out of it for the first time. WOW! The JBL Charge 5 has the best sound quality I had ever heard from a bluetooth speaker. I don’t ever plan on getting another speaker; that is, a speaker that isn’t JBL or an upgraded version of the Charge 5. The clarity is absolutely stunning! The bass is DEEP. I can feel the bass through my whole room! The volume is insane. I rarely have it over 50%, but in the event where I need it louder, I turn it up. I once had music filling a whole event center that was quite a reasonable size. If I could choose one word to describe this speaker, it would be “Stunning,” “Powerful,” or “Supercharged!(Pun intended.)” On that note, the battery life on this thing is long! I once had the speaker provide some background noise for about two days and the battery life was barely lower than 70% (I think…it’s hard to tell exactly with the battery indicator; definitely above 60%). Of course, the battery drains quicker when you have the speaker playing at high volumes. Also, it can take some water. Some being a little, I prefer not to put it to the test. Here is my takeaway:DESIGN: 9/10 Great! I love the fabric covering. The JBL logo is made of metal, which makes it look very nice and official. The buttons are easy to distinguish, and the light is on the power, bluetooth, and there is a ring of light around those two buttons when PartyBoost is in effect. There is a battery bar right below the JBL Logo, and it serves as a general battery indicator. You can get the 100%, 75%, 50%, and 25%. You can get more info on the battery via the app. The weight is surprisingly light, considering the volume this speaker is capable of. Although, it isn’t the most portable of portable speakers as it is a little big and has a football shape. You can get a case for it that has a strap though. For the skip feature, you have to press the play/pause button twice. Make sure that when you do this, you maintain a consistent interval of time between the two presses. If you do it too fast it will just pause. If you do it too slow, it will just pause then play again.BATTERY: 10/10 Perfect! I absolutely love the battery. I’m the kind of person that prefers the longest possible battery, and doing whatever it takes to preserve it. I don’t have to worry much about this battery. Like I said, it has provided some low music for almost 2 days and the battery wasn’t that affected. However, the battery life will drain much more rapidly when using the speaker at high volumes. I currently use this speaker with a projector to watch TV. I have watched lots of movies and TV shows, and I don’t have to pay much attention to the battery. I just plug it in every other night, and it does great! And having a battery bank is the cherry on top. I haven’t used it much, as I keep most of my devices fully charged, but I think it is awesome that it has a battery bank if I need it.SOUND QUALITY: 10/10(10.5/10) Stunning! I didn’t expect that sound quality could get this good for a bluetooth speaker. JBL means business! When I turn it to high volumes, I can actually feel air blowing from it! On that note, it can go REALLY high in volume. I did not expect that at all. Insane volume. As stated earlier, I use this with a projector, and for all my TV. Watching movies with this speaker makes the entire experience cinematic! A much bigger upgrade compared to the sound TV’s come with. I would even say that it can contend with some soundbars out there (not the JBL Surround Sound System though…that one seems like the top-tier of JBL). This speaker was my first experience with JBL speakers (other than the car speakers) and I was very impressed. It has been the best sound experience I have ever had. Really clear and crisp audio, and when I say “really,” I mean truly! When playing music, I can hear every instrument, every breath, and incredible bass. The bass is a superstar in and of itself. Like I said, the bass shakes my whole room when playing music, and when watching movies! The side radiators really, really pack a punch! There is even an adjustable EQ on the app. Though I prefer what the speaker came with. It is a little pricey, (just a little) but know that you get what you pay for! I don’t think that I can ever go back to what I had…PARTYBOOST: 9/10 Great! I had one, so I bought two more so I could create a surround sound with my TV. It kinda worked. I think I had some sort of connectivity issue, so all I’ll say is that the range might not be that great, so make sure you keep them somewhat close. If you have a projector that has bluetooth and you want to use PartyBoost, I would consider researching what you can do with the Bluetooth latency (As stated earlier, I watch TV with this, and please note there IS some lag between sound and video, as bluetooth will do. However, that is just bluetooth technology, not JBL. Over time my ears and eyes have adjusted, and now it is not that big a deal). In addition to standard bluetooth latency, PartyBoost will make this delay greater (I ended up returning the other two because of this issue). For music, this is not a problem, because it is just sound and no video. With music, PartyBoost is pretty cool! It really creates a much louder and much cooler sound experience. You can even use just two for a stereo effect, and it works great!Overall, this has been the BEST bluetooth speaker experience I have ever had. You better believe I’ll be there for the Charge 6 or 7 or wherever they decide to take this. They really have something good going here. I would 110% recommend this! If you are reading this review, and you would like an upgrade to your typical listening experience, know that this is one of the best out there! And if you catch this at a discounted price, you’ll know you are getting a great deal. JBL has been the best listening experience for me. I will continue buying their products if they keep supplying a high-quality experience. I mean, let the 27,000 ratings with a 4.8 overall rating speak for itself. Here is a simplified pro-con list:PROS-Excellent audio clarity-Excellent bass-Excellent overall sound-Exceptional volume-Long battery life-Battery bank feature-Waterproof feature-Adjustable EQ-Stereo Effect-PartyBoost for multiple speakersCONS-Button timing for the skip track-Could be slightly more portable (We do have the Flip speakers for that though)","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States April 5, 2024","profile_id":"AEDM32EKQE2HOHUCSXFF2Z27F7NQ","is_verified":true,"helpful_count":78,"product_attributes":"Color: Black"},{"id":"R158T5SJCSV7IQ","title":"5.0 out of 5 stars Amazing Sound and Great Durability","author":"Miguel Gomez","rating":5,"content":"The media could not be loaded. I recently got my hands on the JBL CHARGE 5 Portable Waterproof Bluetooth Speaker, and I have to say, it’s been an awesome addition to my music setup. Whether I’m chilling at home, heading to the beach, or just hanging out in the backyard, this speaker has been delivering on all fronts.First off, let’s talk about the sound quality. It’s impressive! The audio is clear and crisp, making everything from podcasts to my favorite tracks sound fantastic. The bass is particularly noteworthy – it’s deep and punchy without being overwhelming. I’ve had other portable speakers before, but this one definitely stands out in terms of delivering that full, rich sound we all crave.The build quality of the JBL CHARGE 5 is also top-notch. It feels solid and durable, which is exactly what you need in a portable speaker. I’m not the gentlest person with my gadgets, so knowing this speaker can withstand a bit of rough handling is a huge plus. The waterproof feature is a game-changer too. I’ve taken it to the pool and the beach, and it’s held up perfectly fine even after getting splashed. No worries about a bit of water ruining the fun.Another awesome feature is the battery life. With up to 20 hours of playtime, this speaker keeps the party going all day and night. And the powerbank USB charge-out is a lifesaver! I can charge my phone on the go, which is super handy during long outings or when I forget to charge my phone beforehand. JBL PartyBoost is another cool feature that lets you pair multiple JBL speakers for an even bigger sound. I haven’t tried it yet, but it sounds like a blast for larger gatherings.Honestly, I’ve struggled to find any real cons with this speaker. It’s a bit on the heavier side, but considering the sound quality and battery life, it’s a trade-off I’m happy to make. The price is a bit higher compared to some other portable speakers, but you’re definitely getting what you pay for in terms of quality and performance.In conclusion, the JBL CHARGE 5 is a fantastic portable speaker that’s worth every penny. With clear, clean sound, excellent bass, and high-quality materials, it’s perfect for anyone looking to amp up their music experience. Whether you’re an audiophile or just someone who loves good tunes on the go, this speaker won’t disappoint. Highly recommended!","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States May 30, 2024","profile_id":"AEPFUMZ5YUTQEWFAW7FOQKK4BDBA","is_verified":true,"helpful_count":27,"product_attributes":"Color: Black"},{"id":"RPPZYO5WBVQNH","title":"5.0 out of 5 stars Great portable speaker with incredible battery life","author":"Plumb","rating":5,"content":"I use this as a bathroom/shower music speaker. I can say I have been blown away at the battery life on this unit. I don't play it for significant spans of time each time, but I charge this thing SO rarely, that I'm amazed its battery holds charge so long.The quality of the music is also great given the size of the unit. It's compact and a nice, subtle color that works nicely with the tile coloring in my bathroom so the speaker is subtle and understated.","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States August 14, 2024","profile_id":"AEACBN7FOBQLIKTLCWVKIZIVX5XA","is_verified":true,"helpful_count":3,"product_attributes":"Color: Gray"},{"id":"R3VELE8MJDOXTB","title":"5.0 out of 5 stars So far, absolutely amazing.","author":"TO Scar","rating":5,"content":"I owned several different brands and sizes of speakers. I recently bought this JBL Charge 5 (new) and I couldn't be more pleased. The sound quality and quantity of the sound you get from this size of speaker is outstanding! I literally have been using it for 24hrs straight on medium volume and it's still at 80%!! It's got the JBL toughness with the Harmon performance. It looks great and works even better. I've had no issues with connectivity, even through several walls of my house it still plays the audio like I'm right there.Get a refurbished one: You will not find a speaker that's got these qualities for this price. I suggest getting a refurbished one from Amazon and save $60. I got a new one though, figured I'd spoil myself this time.Protection: The silicone cases you can purchase second hand fit great and are cheap. Great speaker, absolutely outstanding. I also got the asurion protection bc I'm gonna be using this alot near water and outdoors.","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States August 10, 2024","profile_id":"AEKSQ4KY6YUN5KM6XRQLMYRK23OA","is_verified":true,"helpful_count":1,"product_attributes":"Color: Camouflage"},{"id":"R2QS5H43BWOA9G","title":"5.0 out of 5 stars Size/Sound/Play Time","author":"Joseph Espinoza","rating":5,"content":"Had a decent balance of SIZE, SOUND, and BATTERY LIFE.You can’t get 100% in each category.

It's perfect for me as I sat on my porch on a busy Parkway. It can be pretty noisy, due to traffic and cars racing down the Parkway. It has a great sound for what I use it for. I also take it with me when I walk in the park. It's not heavy, just the perfect size and weight for the shoulder. No problem connecting it to my phone or IPAD.

I first bought the JBL Pulse 5 speaker awhile back, and I really love that one, especially for the light show it can do, but it's a little large to pack up and haul. Then I bought the JBL Flip 6 which is smaller, but still can pack a nice punch... but only if you turn it up really loud. I really love the JBL Flip 6 because it is extremely portable, but I decided that I wanted to try this JBL Charge 5 because I love the camouflage pattern on it, and it seemed like a good in-between speaker from the other two speakers I'm comparing here. As it turns out, the JBL Charge 5 is the best choice for me in terms of portability, and sound. It's got a really nice full sound, and I don't have to turn it up quite as loud as the JBL Flip 6 to achieve the full sound I like. That means to me that I have more volume to play with if I really jam out to some good music. In the future I would like to try the JBL Extreme, even though I know it's not as portable as these other speakers I have. Anyway I really love this JBL Charge 5, and I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a bluetooth speaker that can get loud, but offers easy portability.","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States June 24, 2024","profile_id":"AFE42LBIADDXKHZ66MQRD7DE7JYQ","is_verified":true,"helpful_count":2,"product_attributes":"Color: Camouflage"},{"id":"R21ZQZHDECO4TE","title":"5.0 out of 5 stars This thing is great","author":"Matthew Neil","rating":5,"content":"I got this to play graduation party for a friend of mine’s daughter in a restaurant and it was more than loud enough.

They also sound fantastic for a battery powered speaker, relatively full low end and crisp highs without needing to be EQed. They are setup roughly 15’ feet from one another in opposing corners of my studio space. They add presence and a fullness that I was missing from my Notabrick Bluetooth speakers.Now for THE PROBLEMS:I synced the speakers together and switched them to “stereo” mode from the app with no problem using my iPhone 13 Pro running Bluetooth 5.1. When it was time to connect it to my stationary media hub it was intended for (a 2020 iPad 8th gen) it would only connect one speaker and not allow for a party link or stereo link between the two Charge 5’s anymore. It took my some time of testing and no help from the internet to find out that the Bluetooth 4.2 that the iPad uses means the JBLs could no longer connect in a pair. I figured they had their own connection protocol (perhaps wifi 2.4ghz) for party mode. This shared audio functionality will ONLY work if your device that is sending audio is Bluetooth 5.1.SECOND ISSUE:So I put the iPad aside and would only be using my iPhone for music since that’s the only way I could get the Stereo mode to function. But after 15-30 minutes of music playback the speakers will disconnect themselves from one another requiring you to manually go to them and reconnect themselves. Every third time or so they will also drop the Bluetooth connection requiring you to “forget device” on your phone and resync Bluetooth to your host Charge 5 and then relink the speakers.This is all to say that if you want to use more than one speaker, even using a compatible Bluetooth 5.1 device that they are extremely finicky. Using a single Charge 5 has proved to be very reliable, sound great and look great. I am an audiophile and have many thousands of dollars in pro audio.The current tested Firmware version is 0.8.6.0 and has not been updated for over a year so this is unlikely to be fixed.UPDATE: I purchased two Charge 4 speakers to run through all the same testing and scenarios as the newer Charge 5 Models and found that with the exception of the occasional dropout and auto reconnection (perhaps once every two hours or so) these have solved all my issues. In fact, having the Aux plug on this model has also meant I can plugin my DJ decks to them when we are at the park and the primary speaker that is being plugged into will duplicate the signal and send it to the second speaker wirelessly with no issues. There is about one second of lag with this setup so the use of my DJ headphones is a requirement, but I love the added functionality. I also find the battery meters to be much more easy to read on the Charge 4. Finally, I do not know if it's because the transmission power of the Bluetooth 4.2 in the Charge 4 over the Bluetooth 5.1 in the Charge 5, but I find that I get a longer transmission range with no dropouts with the older Charge 4 model. On paper this should be backwards but testing 4 independent units in different scenarios have shown this to be recurring findings for me. I have used the 2020 iPad, iPhone 13 pro and Macbook M1 pro and a HD Firestick as my test subjects.I do notice that the Charge 5 has a slight edge in real world testing for maximum volume and clearly has a crisper high end to it where the Charge 4 sounds a little more round but is still very pleasing to the ear. I suggest to save a ton of money and pickup the Charge 4 if you are planning on using them in a multi speaker setup like me.","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States December 15, 2023","profile_id":"AE5UFAYXB2EX2T4NQ5HFHWATP6NA","is_verified":true,"helpful_count":22,"product_attributes":"Color: White"},{"id":"R1D9I181C4INKE","title":"5.0 out of 5 stars Great little speakers","author":"The pc builder","rating":5,"content":"So let start off by I’m old school when it comes to selecting speaker. I have a massive surround system that sound great! I stumbled across the little speaker by accident. So I was doing a cell phone upgrade and they asked if I wanted a Bluetooth speaker versus 2 wireless stands… I opted for the Bluetooth speaker as I had 2 wireless stands that work great. So I hooked this little flip 6 up and was amazed by the sound of this little thing. So I was doing a bit of research and finding that I could hook other speakers. So I opted to pick up another flip 6 and put them into stereo mode. I was floored by the sound out of these little speakers and the stereo field was amazing too!!! So then I was wanting to see how the charge 5 would stack up and then combine them. The one charge 5 has an edge on the bass but the mids and highs of the flip 6 held there ground and sounded a bit better to me. Now I starting thinking of 2.1 sound and this is where everything just shined very bright. Have the best of both worlds highs mids and lows in 3 small speakers!!! Some of the music that I demonstrate in this set up was Rush - The Weapon.. this has some really nice percussion section with some stereo left to right separation. I also played Led Zeppelin’s- Stairway To Heaven for the same reasons or the stereo left to right separation and over rounded sound. Great news it passes with flying colors and I give these 5 stars all day long. I’d like to pick up the extreme 3 and give it a go in this set up as it has the AUX jack that would make it useful enough to hook up external AM/FM with USB and SD card. In closing don’t overlook these speaker I really enjoy my little speaker and I’m sure you’ll love too!!!!","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States February 19, 2024","profile_id":"AFPGGENH3QGVQQIBUDQY26SDVVKA","is_verified":true,"helpful_count":3,"product_attributes":"Color: Black"},{"id":"R2PS94ZIE9402Q","title":"5.0 out of 5 stars Great","author":"Yudid Perez","rating":5,"content":"Great speaker","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States September 5, 2024","profile_id":"AFTDPPTT7VPHXWLIKSAFKCYMPDMQ","is_verified":true,"product_attributes":"Color: White"}],"page_type":"Question","asin_in_url":"B08X4YMTPM","product_name":"JBL CHARGE 5 - Portable Waterproof (IP67) Bluetooth Speaker with Powerbank USB Charge out, 20 hours playtime, JBL Partyboost (Black)","parse_status_code":12000},"created_at":"2024-09-09 10:22:13","updated_at":"2024-09-09 10:22:21","page":4,"url":"https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B08X4YMTPM?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=4","job_id":"7238854205358737409","is_render_forced":false,"status_code":200,"parser_type":""},{"content":{"url":"https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B08X4YMTPM?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=5","asin":"B08X4YMTPM","page":5,"pages":491,"reviews":[{"id":"RP97LBJV2DJSM","title":"5.0 out of 5 stars Sound","author":"Juan Carlos E.","rating":5,"content":"Love it, this speaker has a great sound compared to others in the market.
