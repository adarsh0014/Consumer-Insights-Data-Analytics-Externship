The sound stage of those speaker fills the room while maintaining a fairly level volume across the area. This is excellent for dinner parties because the it prevents the people near my bar (where I have the speaker) from getting their ears blasted out so the people in the living room can hear. The battery life is easily 9 or so hours on medium volume.The one con with this speaker is there is it appears to have only three main volume levels: soft, medium, loud. It does not get very loud. As you scroll the volume knob on the speaker you will have several regions where there is little perceivable increase before the next volume level is reached.Despite strange idiosyncrasies in the volume leveling, the sound fidelity of the speaker is great! It's not quite the same level as some speakers I've had ranging in the $3-500 range, but hey you're getting close at a fraction of the price! The build quality of the speaker is also impressive and I get compliments on it all the time! 10/10 have recommended to my friends. You won't regret this purchase!","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States August 22, 2022","profile_id":"AHWEX4P5AFVL7JKCTQTXQEX6T74Q","is_verified":true,"helpful_count":9,"product_attributes":"Color: Blue"},{"id":"R3TR8UZDC8RPE7","title":"5.0 out of 5 stars Great audio, great aesthetics, weird Bluetooth, lights on top are annoying","author":"matt","rating":5,"content":"Edit: battery life is great, medium volume and disconnecting during work, but playing music on Bluetooth constantly when not at work, it lasted 2 days.Exactly as advertised, for some reason there's two showing up on my Bluetooth pairing menu, one as a speaker the other as a headset and I can only connect to the headset one.

At first I was super excited about the sound quality, the volume, bass, and overall aesthetic. I use this at most 2-3 times per month when I’m cleaning/taking a shower. Starting 4 months ago the volume and bass nearly disappeared. I tried doing everything to problem solve- made sure my volume on my phone was maxed before connected to Bluetooth, tried using it while plugged in to see if it was a power issue, adjusted bass/treble/volume. Nothing worked. The volume now sits as high as my iPhone volume would when playing music. Occasionally, VERY occasionally the volume will magically fix and increase to what it was when I first bought the speaker. I considered there being water damage from using it in the bathroom while I shower. But I’ve always kept it covered with a towel to avoid water damage, and keep it far out of range of any water hitting it. I’ve taken extra measures to keep this thing running effectively from day 1 because I loved it so much.Please, do not waste your money, regardless of how cute and aesthetically pleasing it is. By the time it junks out on you, you won’t be eligible for a return … which is 30 days with Amazon.I haven’t tried contacting customer service for a response/replacement, but other reviews show that those efforts will come to no avail.","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States January 4, 2024","profile_id":"AEZ3W4UMCECVXAX5GFWEFAVVTISQ","is_verified":true,"helpful_count":4,"product_attributes":"Color: Green"},{"id":"R9KNWBXPXTO6I","title":"5.0 out of 5 stars Sounds and looks great","author":"Jennifer Vasquez","rating":5,"content":"This speaker sounds and looks great!

I mostly needed it to plug in to a record player via AUX. Having bluetooth and battery power was a nice enough but unnecessary feature for me. The reasons I rated this speaker thusly are listed below.1. The volume control has to be adjusted in the app. The knob doesn't control the full volume of the speaker, just a range within wherever you set the master volume in the app.2. After a year being plugged in all the time, it started saying \"bluetooth on. bluetooth connected. bluetooth on. bluetooth connected. bluetooth...\" you get the point. It wouldn't let me put it into AUX mode even after unpairing bluetooth devices.This speaker looks nice, sounds nice, and would have been just fine were it not for the awkward forced app use and the failure of the connection system.","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States May 2, 2024","profile_id":"AH5ONXYCZEWW742DFWIA7MROQSXQ","is_verified":true,"product_attributes":"Color: Green"},{"id":"R13JOQC2OOWDSU","title":"3.0 out of 5 stars Nice vintage looking speaker but...","author":"John Gould","rating":3,"content":"I purchased due to the vintage look and good reviews of the product. I brought to use in my classic car, rather than changing out the original AM radio. It works well, the sound quality is good, and the volume is reasonable. I can hear it well and non-distorted while doing 70 Mph with the windows down, it is not a window rattler by any means. After about 8 hours of total use I noticed even when charged for days the battery will not charge to the full extent, only 75% per the indicator lights on the unit. This was an expensive piece for this to happen already. The battery has not died on me yet, but the longest I have used it without charging is about 3 hours.","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States August 11, 2023","profile_id":"AFY3L5ZEFPCA3XGGGVP7RCZNHMAQ","is_verified":true,"helpful_count":4,"product_attributes":"Color: Green"}],"page_type":"Question","asin_in_url":"B09572WYN8","product_name":"Retro Wooden Bluetooth Speaker, KONEX 40W Vintage Portable Wireless Speaker, Bluetooth 4.2 Heavy Bass Music Player, 20H Long Playtime, Outdoor Speaker for Home, Office, Party, Gift for Friend","parse_status_code":12000},"created_at":"2024-09-09 10:41:20","updated_at":"2024-09-09 10:41:23","page":1,"url":"https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09572WYN8?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1","job_id":"7238859014652576769","is_render_forced":false,"status_code":200,"parser_type":""},{"content":{"url":"https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09572WYN8?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=2","asin":"B09572WYN8","page":2,"pages":15,"reviews":[{"id":"R1GK2TWY17YKE7","title":"2.0 out of 5 stars Doesn’t hold a charge","author":"Mac","rating":2,"content":"I first bought this because an AirBB that we stayed at had one and we were impressed with the sound quality and the looks. I bought one for our cabin home and it looks great (I got the wooden one); however, after charging 12+ hours I turned it on only to see that it has two bars of battery. Unfortunately that’s unacceptable so I have to return it.Additionally, though we have a small living space, the volume knob has to be turned up all the way (and nearly all the way on my phone as well) to get decent volume out of the thing. That means I’m not confident that it will provide a great volume of sound in an outside setting. I’ve used JBL (various models) in the past which have a much higher volume without maximizing volume on the phone.Also if you intend to use this in the evening in a dim living space or bedroom at night, be advised the battery bar on the unit is made up of several LED lights (blue and red) that blink constantly while power mode is on. They are quite bright and will be hard to ignore.Anyway, main reason I purchased is due to the athletics of the speaker, which is awesome. The wood looks very nice so I can give a star for that, but that’s it.","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States April 17, 2023","profile_id":"AFNA3ID47YZV4RWJIBNDTB3F7PLQ","is_verified":true,"helpful_count":1,"product_attributes":"Color: Wooden"},{"id":"RM6FQPMHWZR5E","title":"4.0 out of 5 stars Worked great but quickly failed :(","author":"Amazon Customer","rating":4,"content":"Features of this model are great and it can even play from a thumb drive.
