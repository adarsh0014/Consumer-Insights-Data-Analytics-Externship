Solid buy!","author":"Bruce C","rating":5,"content":"Needed a new portable speaker for the home setup and once I saw that Beats (read: Apple) came out with the new Beats Pill, I bit the bullet and purchased one.First things first, the unboxing experience and the design of the speaker is quintessentially Apple. Speaker has a nice heft to it and the design of the speaker is really nice, with the angled design, and the speakers facing you.If you are in the Apple Ecosystem, this speaker was made for you as it connects to your iPhone the minute you turn it on with a very satisfying screen animation. I'm told you can easily connect with an Android product too but I didn't have one in hand to test out how easy it was.The sound quality of this speaker is really great for its size, living up to the Beats name, filling the room with punchy bass and crystal clear sound. Rated IP67 meaning it is dust and water resistant, so you can feel confident taking it to your next beach party or when you are traveling. Battery life of this thing is stated at a whopping 24 hrs. I'll definitely be testing that claim, but if true, is completely mind blowing.But what sets this speaker apart, and one of the main reasons why I bought it, is that it also doubles as a speakerphone!!! I can connect this badboy to my laptop, and take crystal clear Teams calls with it all day at work. And when I'm done with my calls, since it is connected to my laptop via USB-C, I can listen to lossless music on Apple Music. Mind...blown!Run, don't walk, to buy this awesome speaker!!","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States July 1, 2024","profile_id":"AFVM53KRAU5JC462ZZDBBKTESPGA","is_verified":true,"helpful_count":18,"product_attributes":"Color: Statement RedStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+"},{"id":"R935PCZ92UVGL","title":"5.0 out of 5 stars Very Happy","author":"B. Hinson","rating":5,"content":"We bought this for a trip to the beach and it did not disappoint. Quick easy connection to our phones, good sound quality, solid build and long battery life. We have since found ourselves grabbing it instead of our existing outdoor speakers for using on the back patio. One feature we did not think we would use but really like is the speaker phone function. It is really nice for conversations with family that multiple people want to be involved in. Better then iPhone speaker phone alone.","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States September 5, 2024","profile_id":"AFPN35SDBWBDQAGNSNQJQPQH5C2Q","is_verified":true,"product_attributes":"Color: Champagne GoldStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+"},{"id":"R4BQHA0TLLJNN","title":"5.0 out of 5 stars The best Speaker I have ever bought in my life!","author":"Leox","rating":5,"content":"I really like the new Beats Pill 2024 speaker. The sound quality is amazing with great bass and clear vocals. It's small, stylish, and easy to carry around, which is perfect for when I'm on the go.The battery lasts a long time, even with heavy use, and connecting it to my devices with Bluetooth is super easy. The design looks good and fits well with any room or setup.The only downside is that there isn't an app to control the speaker. It would be nice to have an app to adjust settings, check battery life, and manage connections. Even without this, the Beats Pill 2024 is a fantastic speaker that I highly recommend.","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States July 11, 2024","profile_id":"AEUCX7EIPTMCFN4OJBZHL2OYSVKQ","is_verified":true,"helpful_count":8,"product_attributes":"Color: Champagne GoldStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+"},{"id":"R39X7USU3OX34C","title":"5.0 out of 5 stars Really good","author":"Justin","rating":5,"content":"So I’m super picky about sound and have spent a decent amount of money over the years finding good speakers. I was currently using the B&O Bluetooth speaker which is really good and is a bit more money than this. Prior I had Bose and some of other brands. Compared to all of them this is an amazing speaker for the price point. Bass is great. Clarity is great. Build quality is great. You can even hook it up via usb c to get lossless music. I didnt notice much a difference that way. Also if your in the apple eco system it works like AirPods where you can switch between devices and also locate the speaker via find my. Note I have also tried both of the newest beats over ear headphones and hated them, so I was surprised that this was as good as it is.","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States July 8, 2024","profile_id":"AFSZPNTTLYCLNP536L6VS6UMFTNQ","is_verified":true,"helpful_count":7,"product_attributes":"Color: Statement RedStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+"},{"id":"R2EVRTXO9M1YF7","title":"4.0 out of 5 stars Is it the JBL killer?","author":"Tommy","rating":4,"content":"I bought this because it was on sale, and I always wanted a beats pill.I am a JBL user, and firmly stand by their quality and sound.Does this compete with Flip 6? Absolutely.Does it compete with Charge 4 or 5? Definitely not.Heres whySound: i purchased the Black Pill, right out of the box it is versatile in the sense it matches anything you have. I could’ve went with Champagne as well and would’ve also fit. I compared to flip 6 right away, it is Brighter, crisper and deeper bass at 50% volume and lower.However at above 50% the bass becomes muddy, it has this weird flutter sound to it. The Flip 6 Still Sounds great at 50% and lower just it sounds a little quieter and less vibrant compared to the Pill.The Charge 4 and 5 are bigger speakers and has bigger woofers.The pill is definitely very portable, great performance and most definitely great value for the money.Maybe later down the road i will purchase another for stereo sound bars for our TV.","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States July 23, 2024","profile_id":"AHAMVBSECCNUJMQV6A3BO3A3HNMA","is_verified":true,"helpful_count":5,"product_attributes":"Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+"},{"id":"R1BHCCLK5GZ5VZ","title":"5.0 out of 5 stars Beats Pill","author":"Gregory Stratman","rating":5,"content":"I love the size, weight and quality of my Pill!

The tone when pairing emits a very low end bass note that gets you excited for the performance expected from Beats... However, with this being said, the performance is only half of what I hoped... the programmed sound processing limits using an external eq as boosted bass significantly drops the volume at each note, which is sad because pill doesn't have an eq in its app at all.... the sound you get between 40 percent and lower is where this shines, mids are clear and neutral, highs are clear and crisp without any harshness, and there is a slight amount of low end at lower volume, but past halfway volume and the bass distorts and the programming takes over to then roll off the bass and then it's mostly just mids and highs.... They seriously could've added a passive radiator to the back of this thing and then would have something here.... All this, and the package arrived with the box already opened.... not too excited about my purchase....","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States July 2, 2024","profile_id":"AHAIN2MT2BFGIAXCVJCMTI6NEDGA","is_verified":true,"helpful_count":5,"product_attributes":"Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+"},{"id":"RTDXQGCW5S0SA","title":"4.0 out of 5 stars Almost perfect","author":"Scooley","rating":4,"content":"I bought the new pill mainly to use wired for my gaming handhelds ROG Ally X and Steam Deck. Most Bluetooth speakers today are lacking AUX ports and any type of direct connection. Bluetooth audio is delayed which is annoying when playing a game or watching a video.CON: Only 4 stars instead of 5 because to use this wired you need to hold down the power button when you plug in the USB-C cable, so essentially, I have to do this every day. It's annoying and almost was almost a deal breaker. I've just gotten used to unplugging it when I take my handheld off the dock, it's nice that it powers off immediately when unplugged, so there's that, I guess.PRO: The new Beats Pill sounds good, it's better than a lot of other Bluetooth speakers I've had. Being in the Apple ecosystem it's nice that it's interconnected with my devices. One not so well-known feature is that you can change the volume of the tones the speaker makes when it turns on or off. Use an IOS device, go into settings in Bluetooth and Accessibility. Having a low volume tone is soo much better!","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States August 13, 2024","profile_id":"AHRRPRN7Y4X3UP2Z3YN6EWQJCUVQ","is_verified":true,"helpful_count":3,"product_attributes":"Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+"},{"id":"R10YJBZGOB4SBS","title":"4.0 out of 5 stars No App for IOS.

NO way to turn them off.Also, Apple does NOT have an IOS version of Beats that will support the Beats Pill 2024. Instead, only supports the old Beats Pill+.Totally confusing! Big oversight by Apple. Hope they will get around someday to updating or creating a new app or just add this functionality inside the existing IOS to support disabling of these tones.","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States August 15, 2024","profile_id":"AEF7JE6TACESBPXTYHKCLUEIJVFA","is_verified":true,"product_attributes":"Color: Champagne GoldStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+"}],"page_type":"Question","asin_in_url":"B0D4SX9RC6","product_name":"Beats Pill - Bluetooth Speaker and Portable Wireless Charger via USB-C - Up to 24 Hours Battery Life, IP67 Water Resistant, Apple & Android Compatible, Built-in Microphone – Matte Black","parse_status_code":12000},"created_at":"2024-09-08 14:03:29","updated_at":"2024-09-08 14:03:31","page":1,"url":"https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0D4SX9RC6?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1","job_id":"7238547499659569153","is_render_forced":false,"status_code":200,"parser_type":""},{"content":{"url":"https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0D4SX9RC6?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=2","asin":"B0D4SX9RC6","page":2,"pages":10,"reviews":[{"id":"R1M5XRE8PLEVIL","title":"5.0 out of 5 stars Beats Pill","author":"DCF","rating":5,"content":"I so glad I finally got one, I’ve been wanting one forever.

With my gift card, I decided to inquire about the new Beats Pill that they have in store. One of the reasons I went for this item is because it was essentially free for me ($150 speaker + $150 Gift Card = Gift to me). Below is my review:Sound Quality: In the formative years of the Beats Pill, it has been a very popular speaker to consumers who are shopping for a unit that is under the $300 price tag. Just like the Beats headphones, this speaker is very well known to the general public & even further to the audiophiles (Like Myself). My first thoughts of the sound quality were “How is this going to sound?”, “Will this live up to its price?” & “How good is the build quality?”. Needless to say, when I got it up & running, WOW WAS I IMPRESSED!!!!!!This generation of Beats Pill blows every one off its predecessors in the water. The woofer alone is unbelievably powerful with the incorporation of newer & more durable materials. It reproduces great lows along with outstanding mids & highs. As for the tweeter, I believe this was also upgraded. The clarity from the tweeter is exceptional & performs well even at higher volumes.Build: The new build quality is MUCH more advanced than previous models. To start, the speaker is now on a(n) angle to promote better sound distribution throughout your space. The materials used to bring this speaker together feel very durable & solid. In addition to the new build, the speaker offers a plethora of other great features including a(n) IP67 rating, better battery life & a whole new look.Other Comment(s): The only comment I have about this speaker (Which I am sure is correctable by a software update in the near future) is with the on/off function(s). This was a little tricky for me at first, but I eventually figured it out. In order to turn the speaker on/off, you have to hold the power button for 1-3 seconds (I usually do it for 2 seconds & it works). This may be a turn off for some consumers as a lot of people today don’t want to go through the trouble of having to learn how to turn it on/off the right way.Overall: I would say that all in all, this is a great speaker for under $200 if you are in the market for great sound quality, portability & power. I bought the “Statement Red” as the ostentatious or loud red color got my attention & I loved it (I personally like speakers with crazy colors / designs). If you are in the market for one, either buy it here or check it out in person. Needless to say, you won’t be disappointed with this speaker.","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States September 4, 2024","profile_id":"AFTRAIYZ5AITM2MEV2H2DNAHW73Q","is_verified":false,"product_attributes":"Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+"},{"id":"R2RH6ETU2EFCPR","title":"1.0 out of 5 stars Buggy software","author":"Oomung Varma","rating":1,"content":"Randomly turns on and off after 30 to 40 minutes of use","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States June 29, 2024","profile_id":"AHLZNRGDMJJH73X4RBVXXGA7WKQQ","is_verified":true,"helpful_count":4,"product_attributes":"Color: Champagne GoldStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+"},{"id":"R3A0CT3JVYDFX3","title":"4.0 out of 5 stars Bass Heavy","author":"Geomancer","rating":4,"content":"As you can probably tell from the product description heavily focusing on the subwoofer, you won't be surprised to learn that this speaker is very bass heavy. That's fine for songs that complement that kind of sound, but is a determent to anything else. For example listening to an audio book it doesn't sound very good and I actually prefer my phone's built in speaker or a regular set of headphones. There is no EQ feature, even if you download the Beats app. Speaking of the Beats app, it doesn't really have any use. It will tell you battery life, and remind you what the controls are, but that's it. The \"one touch connect\" feature did not work, I had to manually connect in my Bluetooth settings (Android, Samsung Galaxy S20 FE).For controls there are four buttons. A power button, multi-function button (play/pause/next/previous), volume down, and volume up. They are the same color as the speaker, do not light up, and are difficult to see. I initially had some trouble turning it off because you have to hold the power button. However if you don't hold it long enough it just gives you a battery life indicator, hold it too long it goes into pairing mode. You have a 2-3 second window between those two functions to actually get it to turn off.Volume wise, it does get pretty loud. Loud enough to hurt if you're nearby. Bass of course travels well and far, be aware that you will annoy your neighbors if your outside with the volume up. Perhaps even at a mid volume because it is so bass heavy. Not great for apartments because of that, at least if you don't want to be that annoying neighbor.If you have two of these, you can sync them together either to just make them even louder (why would anyone want that? It already hurts at max volume), or as a stereo pair.For the price, I would have preferred a speaker with a more balanced audio profile. For tracks that do emphasize bass though it does sound pretty good. Overall I would classify my annoyances other than the sound profile as minor.","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States June 28, 2024","profile_id":"AHS6VNLQVHWZLOI3RZ6ZXUWPK4OA","is_verified":false,"helpful_count":12,"product_attributes":"Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+"},{"id":"R31FPPEOE54HHH","title":"4.0 out of 5 stars Not bad for the price","author":"M.J. Shearer","rating":4,"content":"I own a plethora of bluetooth speakers, one even costing 10x this one. But, for a small portable form factor, this pill doesn't sound half bad. It is definitely not my favorite in the sound quality department, but the portability factor makes it a keeper. Right now, I'm testing it on my kitchen window sill and it provides me with adequate sound whilst I rustle up grub for the fam. Highs are clear, mids are punchy, bass is present but it won't knock your socks off. If you're looking for a balance between portability and sound quality, then this might be your ticket at 150$. BUT, if you want better sound quality, save up another 100 bux and you can find a larger (even much larger) speakers that will SA-MOKE this one, but, you WILL sacrifice portability. One issue I found with this speaker is that the rubberized texture on the back is a dust and animal hair magnet. (Two cats and two GSD's...you GSD owners out there know the struggle) It will not wipe clean with your hand, but a very damp paper towel works like a charm.","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States July 10, 2024","profile_id":"AFIPEJWLO34BKCROKOXTQOTHWOIQ","is_verified":false,"helpful_count":1,"product_attributes":"Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+"},{"id":"R1IDSWYH8GDHSG","title":"5.0 out of 5 stars Beats pill returned with an amazing and sleek speaker for IOS/ android","author":"Alan","rating":5,"content":"This is a very small and compact speaker, but for its size, it packs a serious punch. It's comparable to the JBL Flip 6. Sure, that speaker has even better bass, but this more complete package for its price, with speakerphone and in my opinion, more sexy design.-The bass is great, and the overall mid and high range is excellent, but I wouldn’t say it’s the best among portable speakers. This is overall a very bass-heavy speaker. I only own the black one, but I’m interested in trying out other models when I get a gold one (because it’s sexy af).-This is definitely the best-looking and sleekest portable speaker. It’s minimal, smooth, and easy to carry around. Sure, for the price, you can argue that you can get a “better” speaker, but what this speaker offers is a well-rounded package: nice sound with great bass, goes well with home decor without sticking out, and minimal with a beautiful design. It's especially easy to access if you're an Apple user. Speakerphone has decent clarity and nice usages in times.-Even though it says 24 hours of battery life, take it with a grain of salt. The fact is, the higher the volume you play, the more battery it consumes because it uses more power in the drivers and woofers to push out bass and sounds. So, don’t complain too much if you see faster drainage than advertised, lol. I play around 60%-70% volume range and very bass heavy songs. so I get about 6 1/2 hours from what I observed. Yours might vary.-The biggest critique I have is that it’s the worst-sounding speaker if you go above 80% volume. The distortion and fuzzy sound are awful. The higher the volume, the less bass you’ll hear, and the highs and mids kick in instead. To be fair, most small speakers are like this anyways. The best volume range I found is 30%-70%, especially 60%, which produces the most balanced bass and highs.In conclusion, if you want a small yet sleek speaker with great sound, then this is for you.By the way, don’t even compare this to the JBL Charge 5. It literally has different usage, and the size difference is there, lmao. A bigger and more expensive speaker can push out more sound and bass, LMAO. So yeah, it’s kind of like comparing apples to pears, lmao. I only say this because so many people compare this to the Charge 5 or other bigger speakers.","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States July 1, 2024","profile_id":"AFASPTXSH53KJIWIFP33WH2XDYXA","is_verified":false,"helpful_count":1,"product_attributes":"Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+"},{"id":"R310R8ZFHHHBI7","title":"5.0 out of 5 stars Pairs in stereo while \"Roam\" ing without WIFI!","author":"jdawz","rating":5,"content":"Bought two JBL Flip 6's and was wowed with the excellent sound BUT, will not play Apple TV without sound delay so back they went.

Incredibly easy to use, connect via Bluetooth and your off to the races.This speaker is about the diameter of a Coke can, albeit longer. It has a pre-attached teather that seems strong enough. Claims to be IP67 water resistant. It comes with a small instruction manual and a USB-C charging cable (USB-C YAY!!!). They claim the battery life is 24 hrs, and it may well be as we've been evaluating it for about a week off and on every day and it's still going strong.I tested it via Bluetooth, mainly streaming via Apple Music, and or it's size it packs quite a punch! Decent mids and highs, and it has bass! Not tons of bass [expected for it's size, it's just physics), but it's decent, if not exceptional given the size of this, but that is expected of any Beats branded speaker product, and this one doesn't disappoint! Another neat feature is that it allows the pairing to two Pill units for stereo music. It's easy to control, there are four buttons: power button, multi-function button (play/pause/next/previous), volume down, and volume up.I really like It also has a built-in mic so you can use it as a speaker phone as well, and it works pretty good.In summary, for the price, compared to other \"party\" speakers around the same price class, the Pill punches far above it's weight class, feature sound clarity with decent bass, lots of volume, and simplicity in design as we've come to expect from Beats. While maybe not the cheapest \"party\" speaker out there, it is among one of the best, if not the best, in it's price class.","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States July 13, 2024","profile_id":"AGMUT4BKXZBD5PKSMOD2QHVHSKZA","is_verified":false,"helpful_count":1,"product_attributes":"Color: Statement RedStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+"}],"page_type":"Question","asin_in_url":"B0D4SX9RC6","product_name":"Beats Pill - Bluetooth Speaker and Portable Wireless Charger via USB-C - Up to 24 Hours Battery Life, IP67 Water Resistant, Apple & Android Compatible, Built-in Microphone – Matte Black","parse_status_code":12000},"created_at":"2024-09-08 14:03:29","updated_at":"2024-09-08 14:03:35","page":6,"url":"https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0D4SX9RC6?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=6","job_id":"7238547499659569153","is_render_forced":false,"status_code":200,"parser_type":""},{"content":{"url":"https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0D4SX9RC6?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=7","asin":"B0D4SX9RC6","page":7,"pages":10,"reviews":[{"id":"RH5XTQ13T4DZ9","title":"5.0 out of 5 stars Beats is BACK!","author":"Justin","rating":5,"content":"Look, don't tell Dr. Dre this but I really wanted a new Beats Pill as my dedicated shower speaker.

In that case, this new Pill wireless speaker is more of the same great recipe. In a fairly compact form factor you get a Bluetooth speaker (it can connect with any Bluetooth device though the documentation is focused rightfully on what most people will do - either Apple or Android phones) that gets VERY loud with VERY rich/boosted bass. The audio is also clear for things like spoken word, so that's a positive overall.Outside of that, the Pill is water resistant (not waterproof, so don't drop it in the pool or leave it out in a thunderstorm, but it's okay - probably - if it gets splashed a bit or drizzled on somewhat - meaning that it's great for outdoor parties given the volume) and has solid battery life. I do like that it can act as a portable battery bank, charging phones if you need to. It's not the primary function, but it's nice to see manufactures add value-added extra functionality that doesn't require any extra accessories or things to carry along. The Pill appears to be very well-built and should prove quite durable. As an added bonus, all the packaging is recyclable - kudos to Beats on that!So if you like your music loud and bass heavy, then this is the wireless speaker for you. If that's the case, give it a try today!","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States June 30, 2024","profile_id":"AGN7FGMJLQ4WZBWMAZMMJYJOFPSQ","is_verified":false,"product_attributes":"Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+"},{"id":"RG4VFNO4KHL0O","title":"5.0 out of 5 stars Great speaker","author":"K Rapp","rating":5,"content":"I bought this speaker off of Apple online in the statement red!

If I cant adjust my eq to make that happen (different songs have different settings) then I dont keep it.This little speaker just sounds good. I have had beats products before and was happy with them. This is probably my favorite. It is super easy to connect to my samsung s24 ultra.

Which is to say, very good for a small speaker.Compared to the JBL, the Beats Pill is:Not as loudHas a slightly better sound quality.Slightly smallerDoes not have a carrying strap (which you can also use to hang the speaker)Pairs automatically with Apple devices and can be tracked using Find MyBoth offer multiple speaker pairing.My biggest complaint about the Pill is that there are just not enough buttons. There is no dedicated power button, and in fact there are no instructions anyplace in the Apple/Beats ecosystem that tell you how to turn it off. (Push the Action button for more than 1, but less than 1.8 seconds.... how dumb is that?) With only 4 buttons, there are too many button sequence combos to remember. Seriously, a volume up/down AND a track up/down would have made life so much easier.All in all, this is a nice sounding Bluetooth speaker, with some good features, let down with a dumb user interface. If you don't mind learning a few tricks to use this device it will be great.However, if you are one of those people who doesn't read instructions, get something that is more intuitive to use.","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States July 19, 2024","profile_id":"AEI3MIZ54YO5TX6CXG6OE5HGGGXA","is_verified":false,"product_attributes":"Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+"},{"id":"R16YQMK6DBJQBM","title":"3.0 out of 5 stars Great sound, but MONO ruins it!","author":"B Lii","rating":3,"content":"I was stoked to try a speaker from Beats with a great battery life and increased output; however, not having any stereo image from a speaker this wide is just silly, I’m sorry.I’ll stick with the Wonderboom or Everboom.

Can easily get battery information directly from device. AirPlay integration would have been welcome.Controls are simple, although take some practice to get used to. Power button controls both power and pairing. I do wish the Pill could be turned on with one touch of power button. I've yet to test the microphone/speaker function, but that's a nice enough addition.I find the sound great, but I am no audiophile. I intend to use this speaker for what portable speakers are best designed for- travel, beach, patio, etc. It sounds excellent, even at moderate volume. The dual pairing function looks awesome, although not within my use case.Design is sleek and feels solid- but light enough for great portability. The soft touch silicone feels great, although I can foresee being a bit of a dirt magnet, at least on the champagne gold model. The lanyard is a welcome addition, but I do wish it was adjustable- unsure what the point of adding a lanyard is if it cannot be tightened/loosened. USB-C is a great addition, as is fast fuel.Battery life is rated at 24H. Based on early usage, I would believe this to be reasonably accurate. Unit drained about 10% listening to podcasts at ~50% volume.Overall positive first impression. Definitely not a cheap speaker, but you are buying this for the ecosystem integration, good sound, and excellent battery life. Price is pretty on par with similar quality speakers.

With a punchy bass and a wide sound stage even for classical/film music, I've enjoyed using them (yes, I got a pair) for music and watching Netflix. The sound quality from stereo pair is absolutely amazing.🔋 I love that it is type C fast-charge, and that battery lasts for at least 2-days of normal use; the feature to reverse charge ur other devices is certainly nice but a bit gimmicky in my opinion considering I've never found a scenario to do so.📲 It supports airplay and findmy, and I could control it from my Mac, Macbook, iPhone, iPad, and my Apple Watch. A nice convenience feature.The Bad:❌ A price tag of $199 CAD (2x HomePod mini) is just not affordable to most, especially for a pair ($398)❌ The shape of the pill + the rather hefty weight makes it harder to grab❌ Sometimes I'd get the spinny wheel on Airplay for the longest time without connecting to the Pill❌ I could not connect to the app for stereo pair at all. The app never \"found\" my Pills.❌ You must hold down your fingers on two Pills concurrently to enter stereo mode, not v user friendly.❌ With power button serving many functions, I had to learn how many seconds it takes to turn on/off, enter pairing mode, etc.❌ The soft rubber surface on top and around the Pill's back attract all kinds of micro dusts and lint.Verdict: While the New Beats Pill delivers incredible sound quality, compatibility, and performance, it is NOT designed with user-friendly interactions in mind. The many little inconveniences will eventually add up to the point you realize it is probably not worth it for its hefty price tag.Alternative: The Bose SoundFlex offers virtually the same features (except for Airplay compatibility), it is more affordable, has a functional in-app pairing/control experience, has an extra speaker grill in its back, and pairs to 2 devices simultaneously while supporting automatic pause/play as you switch between devices.","timestamp":"Reviewed in Canada July 31, 2024","is_verified":true,"helpful_count":2,"product_attributes":"Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+"},{"id":"R3C48R9442CEPW","title":"Not Disappointed","author":"Sadik","rating":5,"content":"For the size, the clarity and quality of sound is impressive, just don’t turn it all the way up","timestamp":"Reviewed in Canada August 11, 2024","is_verified":true,"helpful_count":1,"product_attributes":"Color: Champagne GoldStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+"}],"page_type":"Question","asin_in_url":"B0D4SX9RC6","product_name":"Beats Pill - Bluetooth Speaker and Portable Wireless Charger via USB-C - Up to 24 Hours Battery Life, IP67 Water Resistant, Apple & Android Compatible, Built-in Microphone – Matte Black","parse_status_code":12000},"created_at":"2024-09-08 14:03:29","updated_at":"2024-09-08 14:03:38","page":9,"url":"https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0D4SX9RC6?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=9","job_id":"7238547499659569153","is_render_forced":false,"status_code":200,"parser_type":""},{"content":{"url":"https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0D4SX9RC6?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=10","asin":"B0D4SX9RC6","page":10,"pages":1,"reviews":[{"id":"R19HJ1IJ3SG45","title":"Love ✨️ 😍 ❤️ 💖 the speaker","author":"Celia","rating":5,"content":"The size is perfect 👌🏾 love the sound quality 👌🏾 I recommend 👌🏾 👍🏾 😀 😊 👏🏾","timestamp":"Reviewed in Canada July 20, 2024","is_verified":true,"product_attributes":"Color: Statement RedStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+"},{"id":"R2ZF60HWQ8L0NI","title":"Amazing speaker","author":"Ted Has","rating":5,"content":"Feels so solid of a device, highly recommend it.
