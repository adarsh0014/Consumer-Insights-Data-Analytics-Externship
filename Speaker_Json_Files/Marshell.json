When I was a kid my father loved to have the best in sound equipment in the house, and I would play with graphic equalizers and lay in the floor looking for the best position between the giant speakers to experiment how to better enjoy the music.Today, I hear music in monophonic audio in an old JBL Charge 3 speaker (don't tell my dad, he would be ashame of me).So I started to get better equipment. Now, I live in a small apartment with thin walls in a 3rd floor, so, big amplifiers and so are out of the question, but at least I could get better bluetooth speakers, so I tried the Marshall Emberton II.To say that I impressed with the sound would be an understatement. With out-of-the-box settings, the sound is more than detailed. 80s and 90s music sound outstanding although, Peter Cetera's Glory of Love and Toto's Africa vocals sound as I never heard them before, they are sharp and strong, sometimes detracting just a little from the overall sound (keywords here, really, just a little).This brings me to my first recommendation: do not mess with your applications equalizers if you don't know what you are doing. This speakers were clearly designed to use the manufacturer equalizer settings (more on this later). I have youtube music and amazon prime music (yeah, I know, no spotify), and my sound with the latter was to heavy on bass, to the point of drowning the music and feeling almost distorting. Tron: Legacy's soundtrack sounded specially dreadful, as Daftpunk uses heavy bass in their electronic music for that specific music. I then set the equalization in Amazon Prime Music to flat. It was a different performance altogether. I could ever hear some slight effects they used, that I had not noticed before.Now, one down for the application. Bluetooth pairing used Google Fast Pair, which was seamless and impressive (it shows appears to be a custom Marshall little window, so, it looks cool), but the application takes forever to actually \"discover\" the device, even when it is already paired.When it finally discover it (which was not too long, but took a couple of turning on and off the speaker), the application notified me of a firmware upgrade, which I proceeded to install. The installation failed miserably, so, I temporarily stopped that effort, which I retook successfully a day later. The update was surprisingly big in size, taking around 5 minutes to download, and the application simply marked the update successful while the speaker was still rebooting, which took a few seconds more than what I feel comfortable with, but it went through, and after that, the application again took surprisingly long to detect the speaker.To end that topic, the equalization settings are definitely underwhelming, with only three modes: Marshall, Voice and Push, of which I have only tried Marshall as everybody else says that Voice is just for podcast and such and Push increases bass at the expense of all the other sound bands quality.Lesson learned: unless too picky, when using this speaker, leave your apps equalizers on flat, their profile is that good.Now, to the hardware itself, people will notice this little wonder. Using the nostalgia factor with the Marshall amplifier design was a touch of genius, and the brass button on top is the cherry on top. Some reviews complain about a single button approach to multifunction (power, volume, forward-back, bluetooth pairing has another almost invisible button, which fits because you are not changing your pairing frequently). If we can handle touch control on over-head and in-ear speakers, this button is a piece of cake.My only complain in this department is that, at least for me, an old guy, the signs indicating the functions around the button, being carved in the black speaker, which has texture, are for all intent and purposes invisible, but once you get accustomed, an use the logo as a positional reference that's not a problem anymore.And finally, the little caveat. Single speaker, stereo sound. Let that sink in.Done? Ok, they achieve this trick by separating the sound left and right with drivers back and front respectively (or was it the other way around? well, you get my point). Stereo suffers a little (not too much) because both sources are incredibly close, but it brings this caveat. This speaker should not be set as others, against walls, like in shelf, and so, because you end up drowning one side.The best position for this speaker is in the center of the audio stage, and if you want to appreciate the sound, you should point one side (not the front or back) to you. that way both sources are equally distanced from you so you get a better balance.If you are ok with the caveats this product is worth the price, I definitely recommend it.","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States October 1, 2022","profile_id":"AEFUDKDNGZTOEP2BCFB4CLUELCYQ","is_verified":true,"helpful_count":166,"product_attributes":"Color: Black & BrassStyle: Emberton II"},{"id":"R1WRMQNY9KE109","title":"5.0 out of 5 stars Simple yet Wonderful","author":"Sunny","rating":5,"content":"The Marshall Emberton is a testament to Marshall's commitment to quality and innovation. It seamlessly blends timeless design with cutting-edge technology, delivering a speaker that not only looks stunning but also sounds exceptional. The iconic Marshall logo adorns the front, paying homage to the brand’s heritage.Portability and Convenience: The Emberton’s compact size, weighing just 0.7 kilograms, makes it incredibly portable. Slip it into your bag or pocket, and you have a powerful sound system wherever you go.Sound Performance: Don’t be fooled by its size; the Emberton packs a punch. With two 10W drivers, it delivers a surprisingly rich and dynamic sound. The bass is deep and satisfying, the mids are clear, and the highs are crisp, offering a well-balanced audio experience. Even at high volumes, the sound remains distortion-free, showcasing Marshall’s commitment to audio excellence.In conclusion, the Marshall Emberton is a testament to Marshall’s engineering prowess. It defies its size, delivering a sound quality that rivals much larger speakers. Its robust build, impressive battery life, and excellent sound make it a top choice in the realm of portable Bluetooth speakers. Whether you’re a music enthusiast, a frequent traveller, or someone who values premium audio in a compact form, the Marshall Emberton is a stellar choice.","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States October 14, 2023","profile_id":"AEB5JEKNO3NNDOMDWCOKF2H3WDJA","is_verified":true,"helpful_count":24,"product_attributes":"Color: BlackStyle: Emberton"},{"id":"R1PKWJ1ZABTB2S","title":"5.0 out of 5 stars Love, love, love, and love...","author":"Su Doki","rating":5,"content":"So good, I bought two instead of one Marshall Middleton. As wanted, I pair them together to get surround sound, smaller size, and save about $50. Although I own two pairs of Marshall headphones which I'm taking with me to Heaven, at that time - it took awhile for me to commit to buying the speakers. That's because I already own a pair of off-brand Bluetooth speakers that sound so much better and lasts many hours longer than more expensive Beats, Bose, Sony, etc. They have all the other bells-and-whistles specifications, including USB-C, rapid charging, 20+ hours playtime and only cost $30 each. The seller stopped selling them on Amazon.Emberton II was a huge jump in price. The difference from Emberton I - is it will pair with other Marshall speakers. But only the latest models like the Middleton or more Emberton IIs. Also, the Emberton II has a grain texture finish. The hardest part about buying Marshall products is knowing if you actually got authentic products. Knock-offs provide knock-off quality and it hurts the reputation of genuine products with bad reviews. I won't describe the differences in great details. The box is printed on all sides that spills over to other sides. It looks and feels real money, very expensively printed. Inside packaging and booklets too. The speaker is very well crafted down to the smallest details and feels solid. The grills are finished very well, individually, without any rough edges or mistakes and so is the Marshall signature emblem. Look closely.The Emberton II sound quality is phenomenal for all music genres. It's a work of art pumping out sound, spatially separating all the tracks of instruments and voices, to hear them together in one song. This is studio quality at a reasonable price. It exceeds my $30 pair, which already beat-out all the other more expensive speakers, in the only way it could. I heard sounds playing in music I've heard so many times, I can replay it verbatim in my head. Some folks might scoff at this price point comparison. But if I'm completely satisfied at $30 or $170 - no one can entice me to spend $1500 or $15,000 I can afford to pay too. I might purchase more Emberton II's to install wireless speakers throughout the house. For now, I'm pretty satisfied.","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States March 29, 2023","profile_id":"AFG3MMBXL5ODHUR3EXHWYGOHLNXA","is_verified":true,"helpful_count":22,"product_attributes":"Color: Black & BrassStyle: Emberton II"},{"id":"R1N4D4CK1JMIVB","title":"4.0 out of 5 stars Three + 1/2 stars.","author":"Sophie's6","rating":4,"content":"Feels churlish to give just three stars. 3.5 imo. So to the point. I bought this Em II to mainly listen to my true crime podcasts in my bedroom. Easy & seamless Bluetooth connection to my iPhone 14max. Easy straightforward use for controls on the unit. I really didn’t need to look at the instructions with that. Smooth use there.To test the sound quality I streamed some mesic. The sound quality for music is fine’ish considering the size of speaker. It’s fine for background music if you’re flexible on sound quality as long as you don’t play loudly, at that point the music will frazzle out. So limited, not surprising. Podcast quality is definitely an improvement from my phone’s speaker and in line with the price point, in general. I think it should be about $25 less. The app is useless. I guess I expected something from the app. I’m at a loss for the point of it. I tried it out on my phone. It continued so say my phone Bluetooth was not on. Even as I was literally playing music through it. I did all the stuff. Restart, reconnect etc. Reviewed the booklet, Nothing. Everything re the speaker and phone working fine. But what is the point of the app? I interpreted from the manual that I should download the app to get extra features. Maybe bass and treble controls? The book claims you can stack more speakers through the app but I would not invest in that as it continually says my phones Bluetooth is off. lolFine retro look, sturdy, small footprint and working out for podcasts. Do not think the app is or will be helpful.If I were to try another I’d probably go with the Klipsch of similar design. It’s approximately $50 more but better sound and working app.Remove $25 dollars off price on the Em II and it’s a fair deal.","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States February 28, 2024","profile_id":"AHIQF7PWHKOE36B564CMAEITLRDQ","is_verified":true,"helpful_count":11,"product_attributes":"Color: Black & BrassStyle: Emberton II"},{"id":"R1YUS7GL3C2BUG","title":"5.0 out of 5 stars Amazing in every way!","author":"Amy","rating":5,"content":"Gorgeous quality - beyond what I expected!

The battery lasting up to 30 hours is impressive, though I didn't just it more than a few hours and couldn't speak to what real-time is. The top metal multi-directional button is very nice and premium feel......however the textured top/rubber surround makes reading the Volume/Track directions virtually impossible to see - you get used to it, but it would be nice if they were a little more visible.I will say that I'm disappointed in 2024, we're still seeing devices with Bluetooth 5.1, considering that it was released in 2016 and 5.3 has been out since 2021.With the driver's front and back-firing, I found that I got a wider sound by turning the unit sideways so that I was looking at the side of the unit while the drivers fired left and right.I listen to just about anything, and other were songs where the speaker excelled, but then others where it sounded very flat, and it's because of the inconsistency that I returned it. I will say that I liked it much more than the JBL's that I tested against which had almost zero depth comparatively, but for a little more I got something that, while larger, has a better sound presence.I was tempted to keep this as an alternative, but I think over time I would probably get annoyed with some songs sounding flat and others very deep and rich (or course tracks and recording quality matter, but compared to other speakers I tested I didn't see as big of a swing between the same songs).","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States June 5, 2024","profile_id":"AEZLB3QWTROAPNV3SIQVKNOFDS3Q","is_verified":true,"helpful_count":4,"product_attributes":"Color: Black & BrassStyle: Emberton II"}],"page_type":"Question","asin_in_url":"B09XXW54QG","product_name":"Marshall Emberton II Portable Bluetooth Speaker, Black & Brass","parse_status_code":12000},"created_at":"2024-09-08 14:25:45","updated_at":"2024-09-08 14:25:47","page":1,"url":"https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09XXW54QG?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1","job_id":"7238553101009952769","is_render_forced":false,"status_code":200,"parser_type":""},{"content":{"url":"https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09XXW54QG?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=2","asin":"B09XXW54QG","page":2,"pages":236,"reviews":[{"id":"RKMZ17TN4I34C","title":"5.0 out of 5 stars I LOVE IT LOUD","author":"The Pusher","rating":5,"content":"...and this thing doesn't disappoint.

We went over there to enjoy a few cocktails, it won't be done until May 2024, and brought along his Bang & Olufsen bluetooth speaker and took turns playing songs with our phones while we enjoyed our adult beverages on the water. I don't seem to have the same opportunities to use a bluetooth speaker, but I was very impressed with the B&O speaker. It rocked. I came back to NJ and wanted to get one for myself. These things aren't cheap (the good ones anyway) so I decided I was going to get one during the Black Friday sales. The B&O software, that enables you to pair with their speaker, was a pain in the neck. They were hounding me and sending me e-mails and all the rest. I wanted another alternative. I watched several YouTube videos and was introduced to this Marshall bluetooth speaker. They had me at designing this relatively tiny speaker to look like a real Marshall speaker. Once I read enough reviews I took the plunge. I think I got it on sale for around $120 when all was said and done. It showed up two day later. I pulled it out of the package, charged it up and paired it with my phone. Hate me (or them), but the first song I played with Help On The Way/Slipnot! from Blues For Allah (Grateful Dead). Wow. Absolutely loved the sound and the look. Down the road I will look into either \"stacking\" another one (they have that ability) or just getting a bigger speaker for another potential setting, but right now this thing rocks. If you go camping or just wanted to eat lunch at an outdoor picnic table with some music, this is for you. I'm impressed. I was a bit surprised that it seems as though your phone volume max is also the speaker volume max, but that might be a function of me not understanding how bluetooth actually works. I was kind of thinking I could leave the phone on mid volume and let the bluetooth speaker provide the amplification juice. That doesn't appear to be the case, but it's plenty loud enough in a vacuum. It's a starter speaker so I don't expect it to compete with something an outdoor waterfall or heavy traffic or even a tailgate party where everyone is blasting their tunes, but I'm very satisfied short term.

Initially I found the control button kind of fiddly, but now that I have the hang of it I can manage it easily.Mostly I use this at home when watching movies or listening to the news with some music thrown in. A serious audiophile would probably want a speaker that allows for more control, but the sound profile suits my needs.I've had very little trouble with the speaker losing its connection. There are only a couple of spots in my apartment (~600 sq ft) where the connection breaks up; fortunately, the connection is solid everywhere else, particularly in those rooms where I mostly want to use it.Build quality feels good and solid, like it's going to hold up for a long time. The speaker did get a light spray of water on it one day when I'd left it on my balcony and it suddenly began to rain, but the speaker was just fine.Of course Marshall has a reputation for quality sound gear, but the price still feels a little high given how simple this is. However, if you can get it on sale (as I did) and bring the price down under $100, I think it's worth it.","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States February 20, 2024","profile_id":"AE23D3SJBYXFUO7OXEAFXXTU2IPA","is_verified":true,"helpful_count":3,"product_attributes":"Color: BlackStyle: Emberton"},{"id":"R3BCUQ5TFZO9I","title":"5.0 out of 5 stars Great speaker !

There is no ability to toggle any sort of EQ. So the sound you hear, is the sound you get. The thing that I like least about this speaker is the function button. There is only one that you depress in N,S,E, and W for different abilities, but it is loose. It wobbles around like a loose tooth. I would prefer a nice tight button that snaps in each direction. This has caused me to slip and call the wrong function and it just feels wrong.","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States January 15, 2024","profile_id":"AFO4OED23PFDXX3AFKZ2T2DRXWIQ","is_verified":true,"helpful_count":2,"product_attributes":"Color: Black & BrassStyle: Emberton II"}],"page_type":"Question","asin_in_url":"B09XXW54QG","product_name":"Marshall Emberton II Portable Bluetooth Speaker, Black & Brass","parse_status_code":12000},"created_at":"2024-09-08 14:25:45","updated_at":"2024-09-08 14:25:54","page":8,"url":"https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09XXW54QG?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=8","job_id":"7238553101009952769","is_render_forced":false,"status_code":200,"parser_type":""},{"content":{"url":"https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09XXW54QG?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=9","asin":"B09XXW54QG","page":9,"pages":236,"reviews":[{"id":"R2Y5JX8KKE6MY1","title":"5.0 out of 5 stars Totally stoked!","author":"David","rating":5,"content":"Like everyone else,for the price you don’t have high expectations,came in ten minutes ago already charged,didn’t have to have my kids to help me,haha.Already rocking out to some Black Sabbath!

Then a friend introduced me to the Marshall Emberton II Portable Bluetooth Speaker, claiming it's as good or better than his fancy B&O speaker, but less than half the price.Now, when I saw the Marshall speaker's price tag at $128.00, I hesitated. I mean, I've been forking out $250.00 and more for other speakers. But curiosity got the better of me, and boy, am I glad it did! The Marshall speaker not only shattered my expectations with its deep bass and distortion-free music, even at volumes that could make my ears bleed.

I have one of their larger speakers that I love, so I was very disappointed that their app doesn't allow pairing of two of their speakers that aren't identical.
