Here were the results:Beats Fit Pro - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JL65GNM?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros – These buds had some great base, and the wingtip gave them a fit that made them refuse to fall out of my ears. But the best feature? Physical “clicky” buttons on each one of the buds. You press in and hear/feel the click, rather than relying on a touchscreen-like feature. No need to guess if you tapped them once or twice, you will know.Cons – The wingtip gives a very sturdy fit, but not the most comfortable. I wouldn’t recommend to anyone with smaller ears. The noise canceling was solid, but nothing special. And this may be picky, but I didn’t care for most of the color schemes available. I prefer my earbuds to be hard to notice, and even the black ones have a bright red letter “b” in the middle.Beats Studio Buds - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B096SV8SJG?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros – Very comfortable with the same great physically “clicky” buttons as the Beats Fit Pro. Noise canceling seemed slightly better than average. Great base. Classic look.Cons – Tested during a workout, a little bit of sweat had these sliding right out of my ear. The case for these earbuds also was the flimsiest of any I had tested, with a very weak hinge that I was scared of breaking off within the 2 weeks of using.Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08MWZHHKP?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros – A neat feature that I noticed only in these earbuds was that it had noise amplification as well as noise cancelation. With one swipe in the app, the surrounding sound was actually louder and clearer than it would be without the earbuds in. Great if you are hard of hearing, or just enjoy snooping on conversations out of reach.Cons – Similar to the Beats Studio Buds, these didn’t stay in during a workout. They were usable, but every 10 minutes I found myself pushing them back into my ear. And this is an opinion, but these are the ugliest earbuds out of the bunch. The shiny black gleam made it look like a large beetle was hanging out in my ear. No visible brand placement either, which makes them appear cheap and generic rather than the quality Samsung they are.Samsung Galaxy Buds Live - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09TBM1L3S?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros – Cost effective! I added these to the test group because of the unique shape, and for that they are worth giving a try. If you have small ears and do not like the rubber insert that is standard in most other earbuds, these may be perfect for you.Cons – Poor fit for large ears. These were tested the least of all of the buds, because the fit was so bad for my ear shape that they wouldn’t stay in if I turned my head too fast.Bose QuietComfort - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08C4KWM9T?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros – Bose noise canceling is unmatched. If your primary use for earbuds is to cancel out that background white noise, this is the pair for you. The sound quality is great, not too heavy on the base. The case for the earbuds stood out from the rest as the only one that impressed me. Felt very study, and I had no worries tossing it into a gym bag or cup holder. The only case with a button latch to make sure it doesn’t open accidentally.Cons – This was the most expensive pair of earbuds by a longshot, and there were still some things I felt could be improved. The rubber inserts had more of a “flayed” shape rather than the “rounded” shape that is standard. My guess is that this was by design, because the earbuds were also slightly heavier than others and may need that extra in-ear grip. The flayed shape did make them sturdier, but at the cost of them being uncomfortable in an active situation. They were also the largest earbuds, and stuck out from the side of my head further than I would have liked.My favorite? The beats fit pro! While I wouldn’t recommend this pair for everyone, it was perfect for my routine. My music taste benefits from the boosted base, and the wingtip shape was perfect for any workouts. The feature that really convinced me was the physical buttons, something that I didn’t realize how desperately I needed.","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States August 11, 2022","profile_id":"AFEITP6Y25NKH3KB2LXWQCC7STIA","is_verified":true,"helpful_count":2322,"product_attributes":"Color: BlackStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+"},{"id":"R3EO2GBST2UICI","title":"5.0 out of 5 stars Initial review and comparison to other brands","author":"philip seitz","rating":5,"content":"I love these earbuds. They feel definitely worth the price and a all around great buy. Giving me exactly what I was looking for.For years I have used the raycon E55 and some of the features I loved about raycon was the manual button in the earbuds, excessive bass and great inside-ear fit.Recently however, raycon has gone the way of the world— they have put sensors on the earbuds in the place of buttons and Balanced out the audio. So I began my search for new earbuds.—THE SOUND—Both the AirPods, galaxybuds and raycons I have tried tend to be balanced and prioritize giving equal notes to all instruments For a clear and concise sound, But to someone who is not an audiophile it sounds very flat and devoid of the punch that I desire. For me- I want it to be great sounding but also noticeably bass heavy. These Beats Studio buds deliver. The company recognizes that your not using these to analyze a song. These are for the people who like bass and want to feel some gravitas in their ears!—CONNECTIVITY—These connect effortlessly to iPhone, as if they were AirPods. It was the single biggest factor that blew me away with these. They are incredibly easy to connect. I cannot speak for android but these work great. They do not have a lot of audio adjustments like Bose but I frankly don’t need them to. You can easily see the battery state on both buds and the case from a pop up window in your apple home screen whenever opening the case, just like AirPods.—FIT—The fit is not as good as the raycon E55 but only by a little bit. They fit snuggly in your ears well enough that they do not fall off when running and working out. Although adjustments might need to be made to them occasionally. (I have small ears, so the fit is review as such)—THE CONTROLS—The controls are simple and straightforward. They are just like what you come to expect from earbuds. Single tap, double tap, triple tap.The earbuds HAVE AN ACTUAL BUTTON… which I thought was extinct, I personally hate the sensor buttons because adjusting your earbuds in your ears would trigger the controls.While these do have a very sensitive physical button— it is easy to avoid while adjusting with practice.—BATTERY—The battery lasts me all day, what more do you want?—RANGE—Very good, about 30+ feet—CONS—-no MagSafe compatible charging-fit isn’t as perfect as some brands but is really good-if your an audiophile these earbuds are not balancedFinal call-If you like bass, and hate the sensor controls on most earbuds— these very well could be the best earbuds you could get. These are on par with earbuds in the 200$ range. And if your anything like me, you will love them! And if not, they might still be worth it to you—UPDATE—they have a hard time staying in when working out, and so I had to buy wing tips for these. They automatically have active noise cancellation on when you take them out of the case… which I personally hate.And the cases battery is pretty short lived… only lasts two days generally","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States September 28, 2023","profile_id":"AFMDCDCHBIWSEI6RDYBCY4MXXVZQ","is_verified":true,"helpful_count":569,"product_attributes":"Color: BlackStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+"},{"id":"R2D114QWXW4IOU","title":"5.0 out of 5 stars I think they’re great","author":"Maizy","rating":5,"content":"I like the sound a lot. I read a previous review from someone saying that the audio sounds really quiet at first and to fix it go into the setting for your headphones and change the press and hold feature to change the volume, after you use the headphones to turn the volume up, you can switch that setting off back to noise control. After i did that the audio was great, nice and loud. The buds fit nice for me with the small ear tips, not uncomfortable. The case is pretty light as well which i personally like a lot. Pretty solid headphones, I quite like them. The noise cancellation doesn’t entirely work, but i dont really mind too much since it still blocks out some noise just not entirely.Solid headphones, worth it :)","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States July 27, 2024","profile_id":"AFRVRGYJJSBAELQK6XVCXXBCJXLA","is_verified":true,"helpful_count":10,"product_attributes":"Color: BlackStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+"},{"id":"R29LYUZ7DI2CS6","title":"4.0 out of 5 stars Quality sound and build, BUT...","author":"Everest","rating":4,"content":"After using these for a couple weeks straight, I think it's time to review.I would like to state upfront that I bought these on sale for $75. I bought the black ones because the pink ones weren't on sale.Let's start with some pros:The sound is very good, just about on par with my IEMs. These are definitely catered towards more bassy genres, but in the case of metal, I like being able to hear bass along side lead, and provides some heavy kicks. The physical button instead of just touch is an odd choice, but it works. The package comes with a free trial of Apple music (which I will never use), as well as a tiny usb-c to usb-c charger (so hopefully you have a spare usb-c block), and 3 different sized tips, small, meduim, and large. These have awareness mode, as well as a noise isolation mode. Awareness mode is nice, but noise isolation causes me to have a headache.Now some cons:This may be just my ears, but the small tip is too small, and the medium is just big enough to still be pushed out. The body is very smooth, and if you're someone that produces a lot of earwax (like me), it won't stay put and the only thing keeping it in is the tips, meaning you have to keep pushing them back in, and bumping the button. These sit in a very specific position, but don't really like to stay there. Because of the sound mostly being catered towards bass, some leads and vocals can sound a bit muddy at times. By default, the case doesn't have a loop for a string to hold on to and the case is very smooth, so you have to buy a third party case and put it over the stock case just to make it easier to hold on to. These come with an app, and it's very lackluster. No equalizer, there's a find earbuds feature but I'm pretty sure it's not GPS, and you can't mess with settings if the earbuds aren't connected, not to mention: why do my earbuds need to update?!In conclusion: these are good earbuds and I recommend them, but ONLY IF THEY'RE ON SALE.These are 100% worth the $75 I spent on them, but NO WAY ARE THEY WORTH THE $150 RETAIL PRICE TAG.","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States August 3, 2024","profile_id":"AEDBORE5CT34E6D7QVXFZW5ZERCA","is_verified":true,"helpful_count":29,"product_attributes":"Color: BlackStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+"},{"id":"RRC5SI8P44LH4","title":"5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent -- Budget Friendly -- Good Review from a Beats Fan Girl and Audiophile","author":"Mary Trotta","rating":5,"content":"Been a few months (May 2024) since the purchase so I wanted to give a nice, solid review.Battery life --- Excellent. 5 starsRange From Phone/Case --- Excellent. 5 starsStability --- Excellent. 5 starsCharging --- Excellent. 5 starsSound Quality --- Excellent. 5 stars (especially if you aren't an audiophile.

Wasn't expecting it to be that different. But, alas, it is. Now with that said, these here are super affordable. If you're on a budget get them.

Here's an unbiased review based on their design, sound quality, features, and value.Design and Comfort:The Beats Studio Buds have a compact and sleek design that makes them visually appealing and easy to carry. They come with three sizes of ear tips, allowing users to find a comfortable and secure fit. The earbuds are lightweight, which contributes to long-lasting comfort, making them suitable for extended use, whether for commuting, working out, or listening to music at home.Sound Quality:The sound profile of the Beats Studio Buds is bass-heavy, which is characteristic of Beats products. This makes them well-suited for genres like hip-hop, pop, and electronic music. However, some users may find that the emphasis on bass comes at the expense of mid-range clarity and treble detail. For audiophiles or those who prefer a more balanced sound, this might be a downside. Overall, the sound is energetic and immersive, which will appeal to many listeners, especially those who enjoy bass-forward audio.Noise Cancellation and Transparency Mode:The active noise cancellation (ANC) feature in the Beats Studio Buds is effective at reducing ambient noise, particularly low-frequency sounds like the hum of an airplane or office chatter. While the ANC is good for the price, it may not be as strong as that found in higher-end models like the AirPods Pro or Sony WF-1000XM4. The transparency mode, which allows ambient sound to filter through, works well for staying aware of your surroundings, making it a practical feature for outdoor use.Battery Life:The battery life of the Beats Studio Buds is decent, offering up to 5 hours of playback with ANC on (8 hours with ANC off), and up to 15 additional hours from the charging case. While this is sufficient for most daily uses, some competing models offer longer battery life. The case itself is compact and easy to pocket, though it lacks wireless charging, which might be a downside for some users.Connectivity and Features:One of the standout features of the Beats Studio Buds is their compatibility with both Apple and Android devices, providing a seamless experience across both platforms. They support one-touch pairing, have a built-in voice assistant, and offer IPX4 water resistance, making them sweat and splash-proof. However, they lack some advanced features found in other earbuds, such as in-ear detection and customizable EQ settings.Value for Money:The Beats Studio Buds are priced competitively, offering good value for those looking for true wireless earbuds with active noise cancellation. They are a great option for users who prioritize style, brand recognition, and bass-heavy sound. However, if you’re looking for the absolute best ANC or the most balanced sound profile, there are other options in the market that might better suit your needs.Conclusion:The Beats Studio Buds are a solid choice for those who enjoy bass-centric audio and need a reliable pair of true wireless earbuds with noise cancellation. They are particularly appealing to users who value design and brand, as well as those who want a product that works well across both Apple and Android ecosystems. While they may not have all the bells and whistles of higher-end models, they offer a good balance of performance and price, making them a worthy contender in the mid-range earbud market.","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States August 24, 2024","profile_id":"AG6LHXKCI7OD5ANROGE4RBXEKWNA","is_verified":true,"helpful_count":1,"product_attributes":"Color: Moon GrayStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+"},{"id":"R2MOD3AIAL0RCQ","title":"4.0 out of 5 stars Pretty good. Not GREAT, but not bad.","author":"Papa Boots","rating":4,"content":"Whenever I see something with a 4-star review, it usually means it’s a solid product but there’s something (or somethings) keeping it out of 5-star range.For me, these are a perfect example of that. They’re small (good), not terribly obtrusive (only some out-of-ear-stick-out, tho your experience may vary), the sound has some solid bass which is helpful for the gym (where I tested these out), the sound overall is clear (download some equalizer apps to play with the sound itself), and they stayed in my ear well. I don’t know much about soundstage or whatever, but the sound itself is clear, bass is nice and strong, and you can hear even the subtle nuances like the shifting of a hand on guitar strings clearly enough without being disturbed. That, to me, is the sign of a good earbud.The transparency mode and noise canceling modes were alright. But that’s just it, they’re alright. Granted, the AirPod Pros have a higher price tag, so they do the ANC and Transparency mode much better. So it’s understandable that these would do the same, but on just the slightest bit of a lower level.I’m also spoiled bc the Airpod Pros have wireless charging. These DO have USB C, but the lack of wireless charging is a small thing, really. There’s something about being able to toss these on a charging pad and leaving them there to charge that’s just so satisfying. Also, was not a fan of how the case just doesn’t have that “premium” feel. The matte finish is nice, tho I would have liked a little more weight in the case lid, but at this point, these are such little (and I mean LITTLE) things that really, it’s not a dealbreaker.My only thing is the amount they stick out. I’m sorry, but they do look a little…funny, the way they sort of stick out just a bit so that the “b” logo is upright. They don’t stick out a LOT, but juuuuust enough that when you look in the mirror, you’ll see a vertical line where the physical button (which I have managed to press on accident a couple of times while adjusting the bud) sticks out. Also, I had a little difficulty getting them to stay in, but that’s beyond pretty much anyone’s control.These get that 4th star because of just how they are a solid enough product worth the purchase. They don’t do any one thing particularly well, but there are just enough teeny things for me that I wouldn’t say these are the best I’ve ever used. (For comparison, the Jabra 75t gets the equivalent of a 4.3 rating…the hear-through is amazing and their app really helps boost functionality).For me, these are SOLID gym earbuds. They play music loudly, clearly enough, and the bass is strong enough for me that I can drown out whatever annoying other music is playing outside. They fit and stay relatively well. For the price tag, you get some good bang for the buck. You could do worse, but at this range, depending on if you want to pitch in a few more, you could also do better.","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States June 27, 2021","profile_id":"AECTDFXXCI5RLPDMMXH2ELH4LJVA","is_verified":true,"helpful_count":1696,"product_attributes":"Color: RedStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+"},{"id":"R17Q87EWZD6NM0","title":"4.0 out of 5 stars Great sound quality; avoid calls in noisy situations and high wind","author":"Wrex","rating":4,"content":"The Beats Studio Buds have great sound quality and a damn good battery life. However, if you use the Buds in Transparency mode (as I often do at work), you might only get about three to four hours out of each bud. The workaround is that you can easily switch buds with no loss of connection, put the dead one back in the case, and by the time the other one is dead the first is ready to go again.One super important thing to note is that phone calls have absolutely no background noise cancellation whatsoever. The people you are talking to can hear things as small as keyboard clicking. Which can pose a problem if you regularly take calls in high-noise environments. A second flaw is that ANC and Transparency modes do not effectively cancel out high wind noise. A great example of this is riding a motorcycle or even a bicycle - the moment you put the Buds in either mode, all you hear is wind. Plus, if you are on a phone call in a windy environment, the other party has a difficult time hearing you. Even car A/C messes with them.I've dropped the Buds dozens of times on accident and they haven't even so much as scratched. The build quality is impressive. Pairing was super easy with my Pixel 8 Pro - I just opened the case, and it automatically popped up, despite this essentially being an Apple product. The app also offers widgets for your home screen to switch between ANC, Transparency and Off (normal) modes, which is helpful if you set the button to activate voice assistant.","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States August 10, 2024","profile_id":"AH5673U2MJGG46XTKJMDJPPRFG2A","is_verified":true,"product_attributes":"Color: RedStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+"},{"id":"R3W44HXR3GUPIE","title":"4.0 out of 5 stars Makes sense for price.","author":"Bee","rating":4,"content":"I am not a sound junkie, so take my review as someone who knows nothing about specs, quality, etc.Performance wise, they do what I expect them to do. They play my music. The buds do not have ear detection, so you have to press play/pause anytime something interrupts you. The sound was also very low when I received them, as they were a used product, but a little configuration in my settings fixed that immediately. I had no issues pairing them. I do like that you can see battery level without opening the case, you just go to your bluetooth icon and it’s there for both buds plus case.They’re not great at noise cancelling if I had to compare to say, AirPod pros. They’re more noise reducing, so if that’s your driving point with these you will not get what you are looking for. They do utilize spatial audio too, but again it’s just enough to say it’s there.Comfort wise, I like how they fit in my ear. Downside if I am working out they will fall out if I start sweating. They have squishy tips though which I do enjoy.Putting them in the case can be confusing. If you drop the case they will fly out though. Upside to that, these bad boys have survived my washer and dryer three times so far with no hit to the existing quality of sound or performance.Appearance wise they are really small, if you have long hair you could easily hide these during whatever you are doing.I got the black color, pretty standard. Nothing too different than what’s pictured.They’re extremely lightweight too (reference back to dropping the case) so I do suggest a protective case if you need some weight to it. I can honestly forget them in my pockets from how light they are.","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States July 24, 2024","profile_id":"AHPNYX3N7YSFKEGN2VREBPXEGT7A","is_verified":true,"product_attributes":"Color: BlackStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+"}],"page_type":"Question","asin_in_url":"B096SV8SJG","product_name":"Beats Studio Buds - True Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds - Compatible with Apple & Android, Built-in Microphone, IPX4 Rating, Sweat Resistant Earphones, Class 1 Bluetooth Headphones - Black","parse_status_code":12000},"created_at":"2024-09-11 14:46:06","updated_at":"2024-09-11 14:46:08","page":1,"url":"https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B096SV8SJG?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1","job_id":"7239645386426552321","is_render_forced":false,"status_code":200,"parser_type":""},{"content":{"url":"https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B096SV8SJG?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=2","asin":"B096SV8SJG","page":2,"pages":1346,"reviews":[{"id":"R1EVKKOTG5RJQS","title":"5.0 out of 5 stars Can’t live without these!","author":"sarina","rating":5,"content":"I ordered these in November 2023 and they have been my saving grace countless times since then.

They are absolutely unusable for my work, which involves video conferencing. This is a deal-breaker.**Pros:**- Sound Quality: The mids are nice and clear, and the bass is tight and punchy when the volume is turned up. When listening to the right kind of music at high volumes, they can sound downright amazing. I appreciate the trueness of the sound, especially given my diverse music tastes from reggae to hip hop, jazz, R&B, and EDM.- Fit: They sit very snug in my ears, effectively blocking out external sounds, which provides a passive noise-canceling effect.**Cons:**- Noise Cancelling and Transparency Modes: Both modes fall short of expectations. Transparency mode, which should let you hear your surroundings, instead adds a hollow reverb and doesn't work well; I couldn’t even hear someone talking directly to me while using it. Noise cancellation mode introduces a persistent noise layer, similar to wind or the sea, rather than effectively blocking external sounds.- Controls: The physical buttons are a matter of personal preference. For me, they are frustrating and cumbersome, often leading to accidental pausing of the music, restarting the track, or skipping to the previous track. I find touch-sensitive controls more intuitive. Maybe I'll get used to it over time, but currently, it’s quite inconvenient.- Bluetooth Range: Disappointingly low with frequent disconnections even at moderate distances. To be honest, they perform similarly to the Earfun Air Pro 3, but I expected them to be better. Maybe I need to cut them some slack since they're a year older (2021) than the Earfun Air Pro 3.- Microphone Quality: Sounds horrible and robotic on a PC, making it unusable for video conferencing or recordings. I need to test the call quality on mobile.**Conclusion:**Overall, I'm not convinced these earbuds live up to the hype or their price. Despite impressive sound quality and numerous positive reviews, I want to be objective and make an informed decision. Here are the questions I’m considering:- Am I being more critical because of the price?- Is the fact that the normal mode sounds amazing with the passive noise-canceling from the fit enough to overlook the underwhelming or broken modes?- Should I use these earbuds just for music and avoid using them for work, which heavily relies on video conferencing on PC?- Will the microphone performance be better on mobile?- Will the fit remain as good when working out or sweating?- What will happen if they fall into a puddle of water?- Can they handle 8 hours of continuous work without causing fatigue?I realize that I can’t fully trust online reviews, particularly with notable brands where reviewers might be enamoured by the brand itself or the product’s popularity. This can lead to mismatched expectations between what is advertised and what actually meets my needs.

I like the design of the case (small enough to tuck away but big enough to keep track of.) 10/10. The headphones performance though are just ok and that's coming from a long time Beats fan. I bought these specifically because I lost one of my Beats Fit Pro pods (special edition ones that I can't get replaced or don't want to pay 2/3 the cost to do), anyway, these were an affordable backup. Sadly, these particular beats are lacking in sound quality, battery life, and noise cancellation.-Sound quality: 6.5/10 overall for sound with music. The sounds is quite low, volume on the device playing needs to be almost at max to hear comfortably for phone calls or audio/podcasts. Expected more oomph like my other sets.- Battery Life: 6/10. I charged them fully the first night and used them for a 1hr workout and for a few hours of a work shift. The case and headphones were completely dead the next morning without charge. So only one full day of use on a charge which again is starkly different from my Beats Fit Pros that lasted for up to 5-7 days without needing another charge. Boo.Noise Cancellation: 4/10 Probably the most obvious and my least favorite feature of these headphones is the noise cancellation. Even with one headphone in, you can hear absolutely nothing in the surroundings. I know some would love this, but other Beats models have the ambient sound option that allows you to hear the headphone audio AND the surrounding area comfortable. I feel like I'm wearing a hearing aid with these.One perk: Unlike other beats these headphones are interchangeable (at least for me). I was able to swap ears which is nice.Overall Rating: 7/10-Not great, but not terrible. Ok for everyday headphones that aren't too pricey.","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States June 12, 2024","profile_id":"AE4SCIH4EIJQNY4BA7TKFA7WD6IQ","is_verified":true,"helpful_count":1,"product_attributes":"Color: WhiteStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+"},{"id":"R3H6SZ25A28W15","title":"4.0 out of 5 stars Really nice compared to cheaper versions, not quite as awesome as i expected from the brand.","author":"James Gauthier","rating":4,"content":"I ordered these as a way of treating myself to slightly more expensive earbuds than i usually buy (previous max was about 60$) under the assumption that the name brand would mean higher quality.

Sometimes my little fingers have difficulty pulling the ear bud out of its case, but that may be because of these arthritic fingers. I also question if the battery life is as long as stated. I love the fact that I can connect to music with the press of a button. However, that same button is so sensitive that sometimes I end up disconnecting a caller.

Transparency mode is supposed to make it easier to recognize sounds and voices so that you know when to unplug and listen, but it rarely works out that way with these.Score down on the battery life for the fact that the Transparency mode uses more battery but doesn't work well.That said the ANC works well and the audio quality for music (including Dolby Atmos), phone calls, and spoken word/podcast is superb.

These seemed to be right in the range, granted I did add the apple warranty thing for an additional $20-30 dollars (will more than likely need it based on the battery life details below)Sound Quality (4.5/5): Good quality and base in my opinion, but I don't really have anything to compare them to.Case Quality (3/5): Case is made up of very thin plastic material with a flip open lid. I dropped this once already when getting out of my vehicle (I guess it was in my lap) and thought for sure it was going to implode on impact with the pavement, but luckily it didn't. Still questionable if it would survive a second drop though.Battery Life (1/5): I must have received a very poor pair of earbuds, because the page here shows \"24 hours with the two additional charges from the case\". If you do the math here, that's 8 hours per charge with the earbuds which is an absolute lie for the pair I received. At most, I'm getting about 90 minutes of continuous play before they are dropping to about 10-15% life. My right ear bud seems to always drain energy faster than the left ear bud as well. Typically when I check the right one is about 15+% lower than the left for battery life. IF the two charges is correct for the case, then I'm looking at a total of 4.5 hours of battery life with the two charges from the case. Very big difference here vs what was advertised, granted removing them every 90 minutes or so is ideal to prevent my ears from getting annoyed/sore with the buds being in so long.","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States August 16, 2024","profile_id":"AGXTAHEJOKGJE3SGZZY2SBKQ3GIQ","is_verified":true,"product_attributes":"Color: BlackStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+"}],"page_type":"Question","asin_in_url":"B096SV8SJG","product_name":"Beats Studio Buds - True Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds - Compatible with Apple & Android, Built-in Microphone, IPX4 Rating, Sweat Resistant Earphones, Class 1 Bluetooth Headphones - Black","parse_status_code":12000},"created_at":"2024-09-11 14:46:06","updated_at":"2024-09-11 14:46:11","page":3,"url":"https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B096SV8SJG?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=3","job_id":"7239645386426552321","is_render_forced":false,"status_code":200,"parser_type":""},{"content":{"url":"https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B096SV8SJG?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=4","asin":"B096SV8SJG","page":4,"pages":1346,"reviews":[{"id":"RQWJEFTQS826N","title":"4.0 out of 5 stars Sound is great, noise cancelling is just ok","author":"Anela kahapea","rating":4,"content":"I traded in my JBL Tune 230NC TWS for these because of connectivity issues with the JBLs.

I use it mostly to listen to music and podcasts while I work on chores. Here's my review after a week of usage. This Beats ear buds has :> Amazing sound quality (I'm not a music professional; so not sure about the little nuances).> Noise cancellation is really good. I could listen to my stuff, while my family watches TV in the same room. Even with the bud in one ear, the sound filtering and clarity are a lot better than what I expected.> You also get an option to turn on and off the noise cancellation. With the noise cancellation off (i.e., transparency) you can hear outside sounds clearer (not as clear as without the ear buds though).> There are options in the bluetooth settings page (iOS) where the \"press & hold\" function of the ear buds stem can be toggled between \"noise control / Siri\" and turn on \"volume control\".> Battery life is very impressive. For my use case to listen to podcast and music, it lasts for several hours (atleast so far).> When the buds are put in the case, it magnetically latches in the right position.> It fits perfectly in the ear. It has the soft eartips that works better than an airpod pro for me.> It has the \"Find My\" option to locate if misplaced.Just a couple of features that i wish were better if addressed:> Auto audio turn off when the buds are taken off of the ear / falls off the ear. The audio continues in these cases. I.e., if you're listening to a podcast, wants to take it off for a few min and keeps it in your pocket, it can very well turn on accidentally (because it needs only a soft click to turn on) and the podcast would be over by the time you put it back on 😆.> No auto-pairing which is a bit annoying. It automatically connects to the last device it was connected. Each time you need to switch to a new device, the connection has to be established manually.> The three clicks for rewind does not usually take in properly, unless you manage to do the three clicks quite fast.

These earbuds are a fantastic blend of style, functionality, and sound quality, making them a strong contender in the crowded market of wireless earbuds.Design and Comfort:The first thing that struck me about the Beats Studio Buds was their sleek and minimalist design. Available in a range of colors, they have a modern look that stands out without being too flashy. The earbuds are incredibly lightweight and come with three sizes of ear tips, ensuring a comfortable and secure fit. I wore them for hours without any discomfort, which is a big plus for anyone who uses earbuds extensively throughout the day.Sound Quality:Beats has always been known for its emphasis on bass, and the Studio Buds do not disappoint in this regard. The sound is rich and immersive, with a well-balanced profile that doesn't overly skew towards bass. The mids and highs are crisp and clear, making these earbuds suitable for a wide range of music genres. Whether I was listening to classical, rock, or hip-hop, the audio quality remained consistently impressive.Noise Cancellation and Transparency Mode:The active noise cancellation (ANC) on the Beats Studio Buds is a standout feature. It effectively blocks out ambient noise, allowing for an immersive listening experience even in noisy environments. The transparency mode is equally impressive, letting in just enough sound to keep you aware of your surroundings without diluting the audio quality of what you're listening to.Battery Life and Connectivity:The battery life of the Beats Studio Buds is solid, offering about 8 hours of listening time and more with the charging case. The earbuds also support fast charging, which is a lifesaver when you need a quick boost. Connectivity-wise, they pair seamlessly with both iOS and Android devices, and the connection remains stable even at a distance.Controls and Functionality:The touch controls are intuitive and responsive, allowing for easy management of playback, calls, and ANC modes. I found the controls to be quite user-friendly, with minimal accidental touches.Conclusion:Overall, the Beats Studio Buds - True Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds are an excellent choice for anyone looking for high-quality sound, effective noise cancellation, and stylish design in their earbuds. They strike a perfect balance between performance and aesthetics, making them suitable for both casual listeners and audiophiles alike. While they may be a bit pricey, the quality you get justifies the investment. Highly recommended for anyone in the market for a premium wireless earbud experience.","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States December 27, 2023","profile_id":"AGIAJSPIKY6ECFRXNA6BPVLSNG3A","is_verified":true,"helpful_count":11,"product_attributes":"Color: RedStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+"},{"id":"R37Z9BSX8A44J0","title":"4.0 out of 5 stars Great Sound Quality - Earbuds super sensitive to touch.","author":"Jeff S.","rating":4,"content":"Great sound quality which is great.

All of their products have an amazing unboxing experience curated for them. These lil guys are no exception, I even noticed the piece the earphones are attached to is like a inch thick piece of cardboard that feels more akin to metal than cardboard.THEY HAVE BUTTONS: Yes all of the major earbuds have controls on the units themselves but none that I've used have implemented buttons so well. These buds have a physical clicky button on each earbud that clicks with just enough pressure to negate accidental touches but not so much pressure that your shoving an earbud driver down your ear canal. Another instance of these buds implementing what others have better.From an Android user: These pair exactly like any galaxy buds would and or apple products to an iphone. You open the case and if you have bluetooth on it has a cool little animation of your product on the phone and its a one click pairing system. Incredibly easy.Connecting to a laptop: Your case must have a charge or be plugged in for these to pair to a laptop. Theres a button in between the buds that if held for 3 seconds sends the buds into a pairing mode where they function much like any other bluetooth product on the market.BASS: YES IT DOES.Price: I got these whilst they were on lightning deal for 79.99 and at that price they are unbeatable. I've come from multiple pairs of bluetooth earbud solutions such as Quiet comfort buds from bose, samsung galaxy buds orginial and pro and pro 2, and Ive even tried both airpod pros and standard airpods. With having tried all of these I see benefits to having one pair over the other but with that price being a major standout reason these buds are now my favorite option for wireless earbuds.OVERALL: These things are freaking sweet and if you can find them on sale you should most definitely be considering them as your next daily driver. Battery, Bass, android compatability, style points for someone who grew up in the early 2000s (used to love those big over ears hanging around my neck i thought i was so cool) and although i didn't focus much on their noise canceling in my review they do that well enough to switch on as needed. If you're trying to enjoy the sound quality of a song as much as possible i would just suggest getting ear tips that fit well and seal. Even with NC turned off these things seal so well I can barely hear my own thoughts - rather just bass rattling - just the way i like it.9.5/10 Really not much you could do better with them.","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States December 31, 2023","profile_id":"AE6EQLGONN4MPXYFETOA3GDK7WBA","is_verified":true,"helpful_count":41,"product_attributes":"Color: BlackStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+"},{"id":"R3VOJ8TFXI1BNE","title":"5.0 out of 5 stars Pensaba que me enviaron el producto mal!","author":"Yaritza B","rating":5,"content":"Pensaba que me habían enviado mal el producto pero estaba en excelentes condiciones!

The quality is alright but could be better. My biggest disappointment was how they aren’t too compatible with Siri. I’m a delivery driver so I can’t always pull out my phone to unlock it and reply to texts. I came from air pods and air pods will read you texts as they come and let you reply WITHOUT unlocking your phone. These beats DO NOT do that, they won’t read texts and if you ask if you have new messages it will require you to unlock your phone. Also the Siri voice sounds a little muffled and it doesn’t always pick up what you say when you do use voice to text. That’s the most disappointing thing about these, I thought since they were bought out by Apple years ago they would imply the same software but no.Overall they’re decent, nothing to out of the ordinary.The noise canceling is nice. They also come with different sized rubber attachments so you can swap them out if they don’t fit right.Another thing I might add is that they’re a little bulky. The first few days of using them my ears would be sore just from wearing them. Again on sale they’re worth it ($80) but at full price ($150) I would’ve been much more disappointed.Overall the sound quality is crisp but I personally feel like it could use a little more bass, these tend to be louder with the quality of voice over the quality of the music.That being said the battery life is okay, it’s nice that the case charges them. There’s also no way to see the battery levels of the case unless you have an iPhone and open the case near it. On the case itself it only has a small light that turns red when low.","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States December 25, 2023","profile_id":"AFFMX6QW56DDKHV6PJ4JGPCEPVNA","is_verified":true,"helpful_count":21,"product_attributes":"Color: RedStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+"},{"id":"RH9H80KCJQ1U0","title":"5.0 out of 5 stars great","author":"cora","rating":5,"content":"i bought the pink color of these they paired with my iphone very easily and are very cute. so far the sound quality is good","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States September 7, 2024","profile_id":"AHJGH6L5FLGSM6RGOUDIG6LLYF6Q","is_verified":true,"product_attributes":"Color: Sunset PinkStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+"},{"id":"R3TQOQD7CMP41K","title":"4.0 out of 5 stars Having charging issues and button issues within a week of use","author":"Kenedelz","rating":4,"content":"Edit: I was able to resolve the play/pause function, they still do not charge to 100% but I'm feeling happier that at least one issue was resolved.I want to love these earbuds so much, I love the color, the sound quality is great, they fit in my ear nicely, however I've had these less than a week and already the case shows fully charged at 97% and the play/pause feature quit working..I've tried to reset them twice, I've disable the app and deleted cache and storage and even totally deleted the app and then reinstalled it, but the issue persists with the charging and play/pause features not working.
