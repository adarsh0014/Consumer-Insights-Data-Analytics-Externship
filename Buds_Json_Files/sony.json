I can notice every single detail from everything, to songs, movies, videos, and games. 100% download the app, it helps tweak the settings to adjust to your liking. Sometimes I forget that I have earbuds in, and it feels like a mini surround sound in my ears. The only issue I have is sometimes the charging case can have a hard time detecting the earbuds. The solution I found was to clean any specs of fiber or dust, since it is pretty sensitive.

They will connect but dont play anything or cant use for calls. Unable to contact anyone so i recommend NOT buying these. The Sony same doesnt work here.

I looked at other options because these were 15 dollars more than what I had paid for them back then, but alas, my old headphones still work, I already own an XM4 over-ears and I think these things are bulletproof. I have dropped my old pair a million times with no consequences, and I believe, despite being slightly overpriced, these will last me years in the same way I have already been using them. I can set the sound to exactly how I like it, there is good isolation, and I don't know if my ears have adapted to these or not, but they are so comfortable; especially because how light they are; that I really wouldn't be able to switch to anything else. I also know walmart has them for 70 bucks, but I had a gift card here I received from amazon so I bought it with that. I love these things but not for objective reasons.","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States May 31, 2024","profile_id":"AEFFLALLO3EPY6WXKJTX7ZO4UTAA","is_verified":true,"helpful_count":4,"product_attributes":"Color: Black"},{"id":"R2DE7LZ1GWUU97","title":"4.0 out of 5 stars Sounds greats","author":"Shan","rating":4,"content":"However they don't stay in well even when not sweating.","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States June 13, 2024","profile_id":"AE2ISM6UVATFXMMMPYHMHIKPA4JQ","is_verified":true,"helpful_count":2,"product_attributes":"Color: Black"}],"page_type":"Question","asin_in_url":"B09FKGJ1CB","product_name":"Sony WF-C500 Wireless In-Ear Headphones with Charging Case, Built-In Mic, Bluetooth, Up to 20 Hours Battery, and Voice Assistant Compatible (Midnight Black)","parse_status_code":12000},"created_at":"2024-09-11 14:51:12","updated_at":"2024-09-11 14:51:14","page":1,"url":"https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09FKGJ1CB?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1","job_id":"7239646672580511745","is_render_forced":false,"status_code":200,"parser_type":""},{"content":{"url":"https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09FKGJ1CB?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=2","asin":"B09FKGJ1CB","page":2,"pages":510,"reviews":[{"id":"R24HNEM51683TJ","title":"3.0 out of 5 stars Buen sonido, micr√≥fono regular","author":"Luism","rating":3,"content":"Son muy buenos en sonido y se ajusta bien en el o√≠do.

They work great and they sound great with most genres of music. When I'm listening to full-blown YouTube videos and documentaries with them, they sound great.My only complaint is with how the \"button\" on the earbud operates when you are only using one of the two at a time. You can't pause whatever you're listening to by pressing the button if you're using the left earbud but you can if you're using the right earbud. This is very much a minor gripe, but I feel like they could have just made it pause regardless of which one you're using if you're only using one.","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States November 25, 2023","profile_id":"AGE76ZRKA7ZONO2CLL4SENRP4HXQ","is_verified":true,"helpful_count":10,"product_attributes":"Color: Black"},{"id":"R3B3JMZ5MZXPV8","title":"3.0 out of 5 stars Decent sound for price but short lifespan.","author":"Bryan","rating":3,"content":"Above average sound quality for the price.

I walk places a lot and want to talk on the phone with my headphones, but switching from laptop to phone is an incredibly annoying process. I wish I would have repurchased a cheaper brand. Additionally, they don't FEEL like they last a long time to me. If you're someone who is constantly using your earbuds then this isn't a long-lasting pair like other reviews make you think. It feels like it lasts maybe less than a day and you have to essentially keep the container charged constantly. Annoying.Overall they're alright in terms of sound quality, but not the best pair of earbuds I've ever owned. They give an annoying buzzing static sound if you have them in your ear without audio playing but if you're older or have not as great hearing then that probably won't be an issue. The inability to easily switch devices is really killing me it's so annoying and the audio quality isn't like some stellar amount that makes me feel like the usability quirks are worth it. Once these die out I'm going to go for a different brand.These earbuds are just entirely annoying to deal with for me.UPDATEI haven't even owned them for a full year and now the right ear bud has died and just flickers in and out but overall won't play audio. I've moved my review to one star, these are really pathetic earbuds, save yourself the money.","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States January 15, 2024","profile_id":"AGFW5ARTFO4DAW6VVIZ6NZYX3A5A","is_verified":true,"helpful_count":3,"product_attributes":"Color: Black"}],"page_type":"Question","asin_in_url":"B09FKGJ1CB","product_name":"Sony WF-C500 Wireless In-Ear Headphones with Charging Case, Built-In Mic, Bluetooth, Up to 20 Hours Battery, and Voice Assistant Compatible (Midnight Black)","parse_status_code":12000},"created_at":"2024-09-11 14:51:12","updated_at":"2024-09-11 14:51:15","page":2,"url":"https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09FKGJ1CB?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=2","job_id":"7239646672580511745","is_render_forced":false,"status_code":200,"parser_type":""},{"content":{"url":"https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09FKGJ1CB?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=3","asin":"B09FKGJ1CB","page":3,"pages":510,"reviews":[{"id":"R13ETCUWXJ034D","title":"5.0 out of 5 stars Earphones","author":"anthony k Kangethe","rating":5,"content":"Great sound quality and price","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States May 11, 2024","profile_id":"AG6QZITSNQ3OHURHOOFISWZOPALA","is_verified":true,"helpful_count":1,"product_attributes":"Color: Black"},{"id":"R3KW6BITHMG184","title":"2.0 out of 5 stars You can't disable the buttons","author":"Trey Romo","rating":2,"content":"They need some eq tweaking in the app, but sound great.

I clicked on find my equalizer in the app and went through a 2 step process to find the sound I wanted and now I have earbuds that have a full sound stage with punchy bass. The reason for 4 stars is because they could be a lot better with some small tweets like better battery life and please sony go to bigger drivers in your earbuds. At 50 dollars they are worth it any higher in price is a hard item to sell in my opinion. Plus they need a better case that is easier to get the buds out of.

Sono auricolari wireless che offrono un suono fantastico, una lunga durata della batteria e un design confortevole.Qualit√† del suono: La prima cosa che ho notato √® la qualit√† del suono. Le Sony WF-C500 offrono un suono ricco e dettagliato, con bassi potenti e alti nitidi. Sono rimasto particolarmente colpito dalla chiarezza delle voci, che rende queste auricolari perfette per ascoltare musica, podcast e audiolibri. Inoltre l'app permette la personalizzazione del suono.Durata della batteria: Un altro grande vantaggio di queste auricolari √® la durata della batteria. Sony afferma che le WF-C500 possono durare fino a 24 ore con una singola carica, e ho scoperto che questo √® vero. Ho usato le auricolari per diverse ore al giorno e non ho mai dovuto ricaricarle durante la settimana.Comfort: Le Sony WF-C500 sono anche molto comode da indossare. Sono dotate di cuscinetti in silicone morbidi e flessibili che si adattano perfettamente alle orecchie. Le ho indossate per ore senza alcun fastidio.Altre caratteristiche: Oltre alla qualit√† del suono, alla durata della batteria e al comfort, le Sony WF-C500 offrono anche una serie di altre caratteristiche utili. Sono resistenti all'acqua IPX4, quindi possono resistere a schizzi leggeri di pioggia o sudore. Hanno anche un microfono integrato, quindi puoi usarle per rispondere alle chiamate.Valore: Le Sony WF-C500 hanno un prezzo di ‚Ç¨49,90, che √® un ottimo rapporto qualit√†-prezzo, soprattutto considerando la qualit√† del suono, la durata della batteria e le altre caratteristiche che offrono.In definitiva, consiglio vivamente le Sony WF-C500 a chiunque sia alla ricerca di un paio di auricolari wireless di alta qualit√† con un suono fantastico, una lunga durata della batteria e un design confortevole.Pro:-Qualit√† del suono eccellente-Lunga durata della batteria-Design confortevole-Resistenti all'acqua IPX4-Microfono integrato-Ottimo rapporto qualit√†-prezzoContro:-Non hanno la cancellazione del rumore- La custodia di ricarica √® un po' voluminosaConsiglio: Per ottenere le migliori prestazioni, assicurati di utilizzare i cuscinetti auricolari di dimensioni corrette. Le Sony WF-C500 sono dotate di tre diverse dimensioni di cuscinetti auricolari, quindi dovresti essere in grado di trovare quelli che si adattano perfettamente alle tue orecchie.","timestamp":"Reviewed in Italy June 26, 2024","is_verified":true,"helpful_count":17,"product_attributes":"Color: White"}],"page_type":"Question","asin_in_url":"B09FKGJ1CB","product_name":"Sony WF-C500 Wireless In-Ear Headphones with Charging Case, Built-In Mic, Bluetooth, Up to 20 Hours Battery, and Voice Assistant Compatible (Midnight Black)","parse_status_code":12000},"created_at":"2024-09-11 14:51:12","updated_at":"2024-09-11 14:51:20","page":7,"url":"https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09FKGJ1CB?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=7","job_id":"7239646672580511745","is_render_forced":false,"status_code":200,"parser_type":""},{"content":{"url":"https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09FKGJ1CB?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=8","asin":"B09FKGJ1CB","page":8,"pages":510,"reviews":[{"id":"R1HBJFP89EYONS","title":"I like it","author":"Er Imtiyaz Alam","rating":5,"content":"The buds are good and fit perfectly sound quality and battery also good","timestamp":"Reviewed in Saudi Arabia April 2, 2024","is_verified":true,"product_attributes":"Color: Green"},{"id":"RKEUDOYGFUH1U","title":"√âgaliseur tr√®s complet et √©couteurs tr√®s l√©gers","author":"Molly Breitzhel ü•®","rating":5,"content":"Pour r√©sumer : j'aime tellement ces √©couteurs que j'en suis √† mon 3e achat !Les + :- les √©couteurs sont l√©gers et compacts, id√©al pour mes petites oreilles.- le bo√Ætier a un tr√®s faible encombrement, et le couvercle transparent permet de suivre le chargement des √©couteurs.- les commandes se font par boutons, plus fiables que le tactile.- les embouts sont tr√®s confortables, fournis en 3 tailles, et fournissent une att√©nuation passive suffisante.- l'autonomie est correcte, ils me tiennent bien toute la journ√©e.- gr√¢ce aux 4 couleurs disponibles, j'ai d√©di√© une couleur par appareil : üü†corail pour le t√©l√©phone, ‚ö´noir pour l'ordinateur, üü¢vert pour la tablette ; je peux bien s√ªr changer les casques par d√©faut, et tous les boitiers de chargement sont interchangeables.- les √©couteurs fonctionnent en mono : du coup, avec un casque par appareil, je peux suivre un Zoom d'une oreille sur mon ordinateur tout en passant un appel sur mon t√©l√©phone.

Gerade, weil man inears nicht so einfach testen kann wie eigentlich alle anderen Audioger√§te. Deshalb anbei meine Meinung zum Produkt.Klares Ziel: Ich war auf der Suche nach g√ºnstigen inears, mit denen ich v.a. Podcasts und Radio h√∂ren kann. Deshalb war mir ein klarer Klang in den H√∂hen und Mitten wichtig. Bass brauchte ich keinen.Ausprobiert habe ich die Jabra Elite 3 (um die 55‚Ç¨) und die Soundcore P2 (30‚Ç¨).Bei den Sonys hier finde ich den Klang der gesprochenen Stimme sehr angenehm und voll, Popmusik und Klassiker im Radio kann man super h√∂ren. Sie sitzen gut im Ohr und (das war mir ganz wichtig): Man kann sowohl mit dem linken als auch mit dem rechten Earbud separat, also mono, h√∂ren.Beim telefonieren h√∂re ich die Stimme meines Gegen√ºbers gut, habe mir aber sagen lassen, dass meine Stimme ankommt, als w√ºrde man mit dem Lautsprecher telefonieren. Telefoniert habe ich dabei aus der ruhigen Wohnung. Insgesamt also wohl i.O., auf der Stra√üe w√§re telefonieren f√ºr die andere Person aber sicher sehr unangenehm.Connectivit√§t finde ich top. Das geht echt mit beiden Earbuds ruck zuck.Mein bescheidenes (und definitiv unfachm√§nnisches) Fazit: 5 Sterne f√§nd ich jetzt √ºbertrieben. Luft nach oben ist da sicher noch. F√ºr den Preis in Kombination mit meinem Anwendungsgebiet sind die Sonys aber absolut i.O.. Ich werde sie die n√§chsten Jahre t√§glich zufrieden nutzen und kann den Kauf definitiv empfehlen.Wer basslastigere Musik bevorzugt, sollte in dem Preissegment zu den Jabra 3 greifen. Die fand ich sehr, sehr √§hnlich, aber deutlich basslastiger. Daf√ºr sind die Stimmen (H√∂hen und Mitten) nicht ganz so klar. War aber ne knappe Kiste.Die Soundcore P2 sind zwar nur halb so teuer, h√∂rten sich aber ganz furchtbar an. Die paar Mehreuros solltet ihr alle in die Hand nehmen.Hoffe, ich konnte der ein oder anderen suchenden Person helfen :)LGP.S.: Wenn das eure einzigen Kopfh√∂rer sein sollen und ihr damit sowohl Podcasts, als auch Musik in allen Variationen dann w√ºrde ich (obwohl absolut nicht audiophil) definitiv zu teureren Kopfh√∂rern greifen. Wenn ihr, wie ich, jeden Tag damit h√∂rt, dann ist das einfach eine gute Investition.","timestamp":"Reviewed in Germany September 2, 2023","is_verified":true,"helpful_count":62,"product_attributes":"Color: Black"}],"page_type":"Question","asin_in_url":"B09FKGJ1CB","product_name":"Sony WF-C500 Wireless In-Ear Headphones with Charging Case, Built-In Mic, Bluetooth, Up to 20 Hours Battery, and Voice Assistant Compatible (Midnight Black)","parse_status_code":12000},"created_at":"2024-09-11 14:51:12","updated_at":"2024-09-11 14:51:21","page":8,"url":"https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09FKGJ1CB?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=8","job_id":"7239646672580511745","is_render_forced":false,"status_code":200,"parser_type":""},{"content":{"url":"https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09FKGJ1CB?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=9","asin":"B09FKGJ1CB","page":9,"pages":510,"reviews":[{"id":"R1PDKCQVW73NZ2","title":"Great product, built to last!","author":"H. C.","rating":5,"content":"I was given a pair of these 2 years ago as a present and love them so much that I bought a pair for someone else's birthday. PLEASE BEAR IN MIND: these photos are after 2 years of daily use so they look a little battered! Obviously they arrived pristine :)For reference, I use these twice daily: one 1-3 hour use with a single bud, and one 1hr use with both buds), and once or twice a month for 4-5 hours with both buds. They have definitely risen to the challenge.1. SOUND. I'm not a music buff so don't know how the sound quality of these would compare to more expensive or professional products, but I've found they produce well-balanced music at a high quality (i.e. no tinny sounds, decent bass) and no voice distortion in spoken word. I mainly use them for audiobooks and they've been excellent. If I'm in a noisy environment (I'm talking cooking with the extractor hood on, or the footie on TV husband-based commentary thereof, not a full-blown concert or anything) they do a great job of blocking out the room noise and delivering my own noise straight to my ear without having to have the volume deafeningly high. They're not really noise-\"cancelling\", but they negate enough of the unwanted noise for it to not be a distraction, and work well for my own purposes.2. DURABILITY. As I say, I've had mine for 2 years and they have been put through the ringer; 90% of their use is outdoors on dog walks. I live near the beach so they have been dropped in the sand and dirt, sat loose (i.e. out of their case) in sandy pockets, generally been battered about and abused and they're still working perfectly. The flexible in-ear parts can be easily removed for cleaning, if needed.The recesses in the case can be a bit fiddle to clean (though I'm not sure you'd normally ned to as I'm sure most people will treat theirs far better than me!) but a cotton bud and a quick blow and they're perfect. The case itself is nice and sturdy and, even though I have the white version it still looks in good nick, especially considering the amount of dirt it's been dragged through.3. BATTERY. When you first take them out of the case, a voice tells you \"battery fully charged\" / \"battery, about X%\". I use mine for on average 2 hours but up to 5hrs at one time before popping back in the case and I've never had a low battery warning (I'm assuming there would be one in-ear if they got low). Very occasionally I'll get a \"battery about 70%\" warning in which case when I get home I pop the case on charge and forget about it, but battery just hasn't been an issue for me and I've never heard lower than that. I can't tell you how quickly they charge because I've never had to time it but the case is always fully charged after around an hour I'd guess.The 'case as a charging unit' is a fantastic design feature and really useful when on the go. The metal charging connectors have never once failed, despite all the dust and dirt they've been dragged through. The magnetic areas mean they snap back into the case perfectly every time, and they're definitely secure in there, even with the case open. They also snap together if they're loose, which is useful if you've dumped them both in your pocket!4. COMFORT. As they are relatively large, I'm surprised at how well they fit & sit in the ear. The only time I notice them wiggling loose is if I'm gardening and spending a lot of time jiggling about with my head lowered. And even then, a quick press and they're back in place. With normal, upright behaviour they stay in place for hours. They are comfortable enough that you forget they're there.5. CONTROLS. I tend to just use the right one (I'm a woman walking alone so only have a single earbud in) which has the pause/play/skip chapter/answer call control. It's a big old button (so very easy to use/no chance of missing it), works quickly, and when you restart it will usually rewind a second or two so you're not missing anything. A long press skips forward to the next chapter/song. If you're listening to something and a call comes through, it knows to pause your music/book and automatically resume once you've hung up, so no faffing about digging out your phone again. Left earbud is volume control (single press: volume up / long press: volume down) and, again, is responsive and doesn't race through the volume levels too quickly, so you're able to adjust easily.6. OTHER POINTS. Bluetooth setup was quick and easy (both on phone and laptop), and it connects quickly (another voice in your ear tells you \"bluetooth connected/disconnected\"). Charging is quick and simple: orange light on the earbuds when charging / orange light on the case and earbuds when plugged in to a cable. When first removed from the case the buds flash blue twice to show they're on and working, then some more blue flashes to show bluetooth connection status. There are various other flashing/colour combinations to indicate different things which are listed in the paperwork if you're interested. There's also some 3D sound system you can download (I never explored this) so I'd imagine you can tweak the levels if you want to. The case design is lovely; it's smooth and rounded and feels pleasant in-hand.IN SUMMARY: these are excellent. As I said, I'm no professional sound person, but if you want something that gives you solid sound quality, and will stand up to everyday use and abuse I would *highly* recommend these. They're a good price for a quality little product and they're definitely built to last.","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United Kingdom April 28, 2023","is_verified":true,"helpful_count":258,"product_attributes":"Color: Black"},{"id":"RUVJQUI24PCQB","title":"Muy buen sonido","author":"RICARDO E.
