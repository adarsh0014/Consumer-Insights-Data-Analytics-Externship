This Explore is amazingly clear. Not much bass, but everything else. And great battery life.It's weatherproof. Has the looks you'd expect from B&O. Very portable. Great connectivity.I also have the Beoplay A1 (1st generation. Very important). The A1 does have the bass, but not the battery life. And the connectivity of the A1 is tricky. But I prefer the A1 sound. I've owned several.I really like the B&O app, also.Check out B&O's headphones. They have the best sound of all.","Reviewed in the United States September 2, 2024",AEOMNSFUKAOLDVBX7HYX64VEXTEQ,True,0,Color: NavyStyle: Bluetooth speaker

It doesn't have any bass to speak of, but it does have richly textured lower midtones (which I'd say are more important), and sparkling treble notes. My wife also loves it. If I was hosting barbecues, and inviting company over, it would not be nearly big enough. For parties I'd get the larger model B&O portable. But I just put this little thing on the patio table with the wine and snacks, and its perfect for myself and my wife. Battery life seems to be very good.

R2N9LGOT33J14T,B08YRT9T38,4.0 out of 5 stars A Posh Music speaker!,RT - Gadget Guy,4,"B&O makes posh high end audio gear‚Ä¶.gear which showcases the most avant-garde design which would be at home in any modern art museum (MOMA indeed has some of the past B&O iconic products in their exhibits). Normally their gear is priced out of the range of normal-average-hard-working folk ($10000 speakers for example), but with this product, you can get to experience a slice of the life of the upper 0.1%!In all seriousness, this is a regular tiny Bluetooth speaker which has a price at least 5X more than your average tiny Bluetooth speaker. So what do you get for that premium? First, the whole shell is made of metal. It feels cool to the touch. It has hard ‚ÄúType II anodization‚Äù on the aluminum shell which will help resist scratches, and should take the hard knocks while it‚Äôs hanging off your backpack using the supplied carabiner clip. The speaker is IPX67 meaning it‚Äôs water and dust resistant. You can immerse the whole thing into water for a very short period even.Soundwise, this is a tiny speaker so don‚Äôt expect much in terms of volume and thump. It will start to distort if you try to turn it up too high (it's not going to fill a large room in your house). It sounds smooth and the tonality is slightly warm (you hear less of the treble and more of the midrange). Deep bass is nonexistent, but there‚Äôs just enough of upper bass tones that you can follow the rhythm of the beat. Measurements on other review sites show that it doesn‚Äôt reproduce any content below 100Hz. Basically, it doesn‚Äôt reinvent any laws of acoustics and still sounds like a small speaker. But the overall sound quality is clean and the tonality is pleasant. it‚Äôs a portable speaker that you can carry with you anywhere, so you can have some music while boating, at the beach, hiking, camping etc. It just works!Battery life is good, at lower and moderate volumes, it easily lasts 10+ hours. Controls are simple: power, volume, play/pause/skip forward backwards. It isn‚Äôt necessary to install the app but the app is useful because it gives you the exact battery percentage, turn-off the auto-standby feature if you don‚Äôt want it, and has some presets to select a different sound signature or alternatively you can fine tune the strength of the treble/midrange/bass precisely by moving around a slider into four quadrants on the screen. I think it sounds fine with the default ‚Äúoptimized‚Äù preset. Also as a bonus, you can plug this into your computer with the USB and used it like a wired USB speaker. You can pair two Bluetooth devices to it, which is the norm nowadays.So is it worth it? By the way, I bought this at a 45% discount (check amazon price history for this product) and even though it‚Äôs still not inexpensive, I feel it is good value. Even if it had cost more, I would not have been disappointed. I don‚Äôt mind paying more for something that feels like it‚Äôs going to last, and with B&O, you get some cutting edge design with great sound engineering.This is a 5 star product, but minus 1 star just because I would have liked to have a microphone so that it acts as speakerphone. Also, because of the bluetooth profile, your device won't show the battery percentage on the phone itself, you have to view the percentage in the app. And the sound is good but it doesn't manage to break any laws of physics (not blaming the speaker but I had hoped that it would really stand out among other small speakers of this size with the bag of tricks that B&O geniuses have up their sleeves. The result is merely very good rather than exceptional). So result is 4 out of 5","Reviewed in the United States March 3, 2024",AE6TVTGGPRUEMJMSIV5SX6NDA2PA,True,7,Color: NavyStyle: Bluetooth speaker

I bring the bass up a bit for my setting. This speaker has a solid/rugged build. Since the sound projects 360 degrees the sound is balanced in all directions. Since we'll be using the Explore for playing music from our patio table this makes the experience pleasurable for all. The IOS/Android app is very weak but once it's set up you don't need to use it again. Note, this is not a party speaker. It's meant to provide clean,accurate, low volume background music.","Reviewed in the United States June 24, 2024",AGDYLA7QS2TXWBTITQ2OMV7XNSQQ,True,4,Color: Black AnthraciteStyle: Bluetooth speaker

RMFEKPJTVWHES,B08YRT9T38,3.0 out of 5 stars It‚Äôs good but I‚Äôm a little disappointed,Garden nymph,3,"I have had many wireless speakers. UE boom, UE roll (both good for the money). I have a Harmon kardon gen 1 or 2 Bluetooth that sounds excellent. I have an Audi A 5 convertible with a B and O sound system that is just the best thing ever. I had never heard B and O until I got the Audi. So. Now I have refurbished a vintage travel trailer and wanted some killer sound while I‚Äôm camping. It‚Äôs a small space so I don‚Äôt need anything like the Harmon Kardon. Plus that needs an outlet. So I‚Äôm thinking what does B and O offer in a small package? I got this speaker for $118 because of the gray color I guess. It was cheaper than black. I downloaded the app. And with some adjustments to the bass /treble on the app I was able to get a satisfactory sound. Was I blown away. Sadly not. I was expecting a lot more from B and O. Even if it‚Äôs just a wireless speaker. It‚Äôs not bad by any means. And I guess for the price it‚Äôs a good value. I guess I‚Äôm comparing it to my Audi stereo system which is just amazing. ü§© I can crank it to infinity and it‚Äôs crystal clear. I like crisp sound that I can distinctly hear all the beautiful components. Is that too much to ask for in a wireless Bluetooth speaker from the infamous B and O? Like l said it‚Äôs not bad any means. But I guess my expectations were too high. It can be cranked to a point. But I‚Äôd like it louder. Anyway. Just my rambling thoughts. I‚Äôm in my little camper now drinking some beer on a sunny Saturday afternoon listening to some jazz and just chillin.

As an avid audiophile with a penchant for high-end audio equipment, I was excited to add this to my collection. The build quality is exceptional, a true testament to the craftsmanship that went into its design. However, when it comes to the volume, I can't help but feel a sense of disappointment. The sound it produces, while undoubtedly of high quality, is a bit subdued for my taste. As someone who values the intricacies and nuances of audio, I expected more power and presence. While I appreciate the materials and construction, the volume, and the bass issue leaves me wanting more. While I understand the need for portability, the subdued volume simply doesn't cut it for me. Music should have the power to fill a space, to move people, and to evoke emotions, and this speaker falls short in that department. It's crucial for me to have a device that can truly capture the essence of my music, and unfortunately, this one falls short in that regard for those reasons I have to give it 4 stars instead of 5 stars.","Reviewed in the United States October 13, 2023",AFUJHHCQZAAFBM6YYCAIOHJOIIBA,True,10,Color: Black AnthraciteStyle: Bluetooth speaker

R2OOWD9I530XTQ,B08YRT9T38,4.0 out of 5 stars Absolute gem.......but a disappointing low amount of bass,Tim,4,"Let me start off by saying I did a LOT for research on smaller Bluetooth speakers before making a purchase ‚Äì which includes reading review/articles and listening to YouTube reviews. I currently have a 3rd generation Oontz Angle 3 Ultra that‚Äôs I‚Äôve had for 6 years and was in need of replacing ‚Äì not because it was worn out, but I just wanted something newer and nicer but generally the same size with more power/more clarity. The B&O explore caught my attention right away due to the design and name. The price seemed a bit eye-watering, but I was really attracted to the battery life (a must for me), the design (very modern and durable), and the fact that is wasn‚Äôt a ‚Äòsmart speak‚Äô. I purchased the speaker, and downloaded the B&O app. The app is a MUST if you want ANY bass projection at all. Everything about this speaker is perfect for me‚Ä¶..except for the bass. There just isn‚Äôt any bass! Even with the app settings set to product as much bass as possible, the Explore just can‚Äôt deliver. Ultimately, this is a disappointment, as the price tag just doesn‚Äôt justify the sounds quality. All B&O need to do is add a little more bass for a perfect ‚Äì if expensive ‚Äì speaker! A it stands the JBL Flip 6 is the perfect speaker in this category and is only about $100 ‚Äì so half the price of the B&O Explore. Here hoping B&O will make a Explore 2.0 with more bass, but will retain everything else that makes this speaker so cool.","Reviewed in the United States June 5, 2023",AHQTQTOQV5PGD55DUMHONIDGOHCQ,True,19,Color: NavyStyle: Bluetooth speaker

I was trying to decide between this and the JBL Flip 5 and two things really sold me on this. The 360 sound and the cool design. With the 'tweaking' I did, it sounds great.

Cox,2,"Seemed like it was well made at first , but then you turn it on and you realize what a bad choice you've made. For the price you're paying, you could get 2 or maybe 3 WAY BETTER bluetooth speakers. Luckily I got this one on sale. Unfortunately, because I thought this would be a great product because this a well respected brand, I threw out the box it came in, otherwise I would have returned it. There is absolutely no bass, it's not that loud, the app is glitchy and won't change the equalizer. If you want to spend the a little less money and get a really good product, get a Harmon / Kardon Luna for $100 less. Or a Soundcore Motion X600 for $50 less. Those things sound a million times better. One that surprised me was the UE Wonder Boom 4 for only $100, and it's a similar size with twice the max volume and way better sound. Severely disappointed.

The price for this speaker I feel is worth every penny. The speaker does have weight to it. Not too heavy but because it is made out of quality metal it adds weight compared to cheap plastic ones. However that weight provides better sound since there is no rattling like plastic speakers. It‚Äôs a great size and looks amazing wherever you put it. It performs great in small rooms but in large rooms if you put it towards the center of the room it really fills the room. The sound is incredible for something so small. The quality of the sound doesn‚Äôt change as you turn it even all the way up. I was really impressed at what a clean sound it has. I do move it from room to room and bought it primarily for around the house but have also used it outside and taken it with me. Because it‚Äôs metal and looks so good and I want to keep it that way when putting it in a bag I put it in a small case type bag. However I haven‚Äôt been overly careful sign it around the house and even dropped it and nothing happened to it. The strap is well made also and really convenient and looks good because it‚Äôs well made as well.

I used to have a wonderboom and was happy with it until it finally croaked. I wanted something with long battery life, that was waterproof and decently rugged, and that had good sound quality. I initially bought another wonderboom but hated it! I did tons of research because I needed to replace it with something. I bring my little speaker everywhere and use it all the time. I‚Äôm so glad I gave this a shot. It‚Äôs perfect for my needs. I expected good sound quality, but I think that the sound quality on the Beosound Explore is *great* when you consider where it‚Äôs coming from. Everything is super balanced, and the app is useful if you want to do a bit of ‚Äúfine tuning‚Äù to the EQ. It charges via USB-C. And I love that it comes with a little strap and carabiner. I use that all the time, actually, and it‚Äôs super convenient. The design and craftsmanship on the whole is stunning, and something I really appreciate. I feel like the machined aluminum casing probably lends to the sound quality this little thing can produce, but I‚Äôm not a sound engineer so this is just speculation. I got this for a steal of a deal on prime day - I think I paid like $130. For that price, I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything better. If this speaker had a microphone, I think that would take it to the next level and make it worthy of some extra cash, but it‚Äôs not something I really need. My only two gripes are the design of the top - it collects water since there is a lip around the edge. The other is that it did sound a little ‚Äútinny‚Äù once when I probably turned the volume up way too much on one particular song - by way too much, I mean all the way up, like 100%. So unless you frequently do that, you‚Äôll probably never experience it.Update 1 year and 2 months later - the speaker has started failing. It is distorting whatever audio I try to play.

But lack of basic functions make it a waste of money, especially as it wastes so much time. It usually powers on at full volume, no matter how volume is adjusted on the device it‚Äôs connected to.And adjusting volume from your device is randomly not an option. also you need to download an app to use it at all. If more than one device has it saved, you don‚Äôt get to decide which device the speaker will connect to. Mid-play, the speaker will switch to the other device, then in order to switch back, you‚Äôd have to forget the speaker on one device or turn off Bluetooth. It takes a very particular situation for uninterrupted and dramatic comedy-free playback. I already spent way too much money and time to switch out so I am now on a journey of learning to let this thing helo me laugh at myself LOL.","Reviewed in the United States May 10, 2024",AGDYCI2PZ6BZV5TQ42VAJKN3O6UQ,True,3,Color: ChestnutStyle: Bluetooth speaker

I mainly listen to classical music and popular music.I pick Explore because it has the ability to present the music I love in a very good and pleasant way.Sound quality:Bose‚Äôs sound is nice, but it is too emphasized on bass that the music became incorrect. Sonos‚Äô Roam is a close runner-up, but it‚Äôs sound is too soft in the bass and too puncture in the middle. Emberton is great for the popular music but for classical music, some wind instruments sound a bit wrong. The A1 from B&Q is surprisingly a bit spread out that the focus went too far. Explore is a small speaker that has the fault of closed up sound that every small speaker has, but it shows the ability to produce a pleasant balance that I love.Functions:The last thing I want is they recording my shower singing in those Alexa/Siri enable smart speaker, so this speaker is best for privacy concerns.I recommend you download the app and play around to find the sound you like!

RDUDX86L13ELO,B08YRT9T38,5.0 out of 5 stars I really like it!,Rod,5,"I‚Äôve seen too many bad reviews on this one so I wanted to give my opinion. First bear in mind that not all speakers are for everyone. Speakers are like clothes, perfumes, etc. You choose them according to your tastes but in order to buy the right one (speakers) first you you need to ask yourself a couple of questions. What kind of music do I listen to? What kind of brand do I relate with? What am I expecting of it? This portable speaker doesn‚Äôt really have deep bass, TRUE, but it is there. Apart from that, the voicing of it is great. The vocals sound clear and warm and its ability of playing a song with lots of sounds and instruments is great for such a small portable speaker.I own many portable speakers including the Bose revolve+ and I prefer the Explore in most of the cases. Again, if you want a speaker for extreme bass music, this is not the one, but if you like Vocal music, smooth Jazz like Diana Krall you are going to love it.If you want a party speaker this is not the one either, but if you want a speaker that accompanies you during your walks or have it with you in your office or home without stealing all your attention this is the one for you because although this little speaker can get loud it does it with class and without being obnoxious.

Initially, I was impressed by its aesthetics. However, my experience quickly soured as the battery stopped working, making it the fifth quality problem I've encountered with a product from this brand.In all honesty, I found this Bang & Olufsen speaker to be disappointing. The brand's reputation suggests top-tier products, but this speaker left much to be desired. The fact that this is my fifth quality problem with a Bang & Olufsen product strongly suggests a recurring issue with their quality control and reliability.While the designs and external materials are undeniably cool and visually appealing, it's clear that the internal components don't match up. When it comes to speakers, the sound quality is paramount, and in this aspect, I was underwhelmed. The claim that older products from competitors like Bose, Marshall, JBL, and Sony perform better and offer superior sound quality even with cheaper exterior materials holds weight based on my experience.In conclusion, I would caution potential buyers to think twice before investing in expensive products from the Bang & Olufsen brand. While they excel in aesthetics, the quality and performance of their speakers may not meet your expectations, and the fact that this is my fifth quality problem with their products suggests a larger issue within the brand. There are more reliable alternatives available in the market.","Reviewed in the United States October 25, 2023",AGR7LJUYQZ5HEIV24E6S6WXHSUTQ,True,12,Color: GreenStyle: Bluetooth speaker

R2TB41OYEQ665X,B099TJGJ91,5.0 out of 5 stars Simply great.,Jake,5,"I have thoroughly enjoyed my entire ownership of this speaker.Time of writing this review is roughly 8 months after purchase, having used this speaker practically every single day since. This was a replacement for a very well-loved but somewhat lacking B&O (P3?) oval-shaped speaker that inspired of few of my must-have features.My key requirements in purchasing a speaker at this price point were:- Punchy, solid bass, with high accuracy, clear playback throughout most of the volume range- Relatively attractive, understated, simple design with ergonomic and intuitive controls- Easily oriented for high quality playback in a variety of different situations (facing sideways, upwards, at angles)- Long-lasting battery without any obnoxious constant playback interruptions informing you of battery life remainingThis speaker delivers on all of these.The bass is incredibly clear, with no horrible warbling and distortion that‚Äôs very common with dozens of other similar speakers. The audio playback is very crisp and clear, with no noticeable quality losses. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs not perfect, but it‚Äôs more than adequate for 95%+ of people. Even at low volumes, the quality is still extremely high. There is a usable, enjoyable sound at every volume level.The design is simple, but handsome. It does not look obnoxious or out of place anywhere. It is just the right size, not too large to pop into a bag, and not too small as to have low-power drivers with poor sound. Very easy to transport. The squared design makes it very stable on most surfaces, but is still rounded enough not to get caught on things. The controls are very easy to understand, even the multi-device Bluetooth cycling and syncing. I have no complaints.The speaker works well for playback in nearly any position, especially when placed on a table or other nice playback surface. It can be placed facing upward, and the speaker enhances playback for all-around sound. When placed horizontally, the same happens for directional playback. Very impressive stability in a wide variety of situations. Some would consider the lack of a lanyard or string to be a downside for this point, but there is massive benefits to keeping this speaker on a surface.The battery life is incredible. Vastly longer than I had really expected for this speaker. With my personal usage (middle volume range, 2-3 uses a day for 30 to 60 minutes at a time), I usually recharge every 1-2 weeks. Not sure what exactly that equates to in real playback time, but I still find it impressive. The speaker will notify you at 20% and 10% battery level, which is exactly what I wanted. Many other speakers will interrupt playback at 75%, 50%, etc. I‚Äôve not experienced any noticeable battery decay during my ownership, but I have only fully depleted and nearly fully recharged the entire time, with no ‚Äúfilling up‚Äù in between.Downsides do exist, but most are inconsequential for me.- The audible indicators that inform you of which device you are connected to can sometimes feel a bit sluggish, especially with long device names.- I feel the price point is still a bit on the high side for the value, but I feel I‚Äôve more than gotten my money‚Äôs worth. I just like a good deal.- Volume occasionally spikes very high in certain scenarios when switching between devices, but is fairly easily turned down after a quick scare.I would highly recommend this speaker to anyone in the market for a speaker at this price point. This is an especially good deal on sale. If you‚Äôre still reading at this point, just get the damn thing on the way.","Reviewed in the United States May 4, 2024",AHZBIFMKWWZHILYEIYOSP4AIA37Q,True,255,Color: Black

R2Y3WBHYS3U0M4,B099TJGJ91,5.0 out of 5 stars A premium speaker in a sturdy package.,Reviewer MHM 3-5,5,"I bought this speaker because I wanted a way to listen to music while grilling in my backyard. I had no expectations of it being a ‚Äúparty‚Äù speaker or anything of the like.But my goodness. This speaker punched above the weight I expected and what reviewers claim. They say it‚Äôs good for less than 10 people. Probably true if in an enclosed space.Outside, standing in the corner of my backyard about 40+ feet away, the speaker volume is at about 60-70% and with the air conditioner droning on I can still hear this speaker, and the vocals are clear, the instruments are clear, and there‚Äôs even some punch of the bass. It‚Äôs so much more potent than I expected.I actually bought a second one (the one pictured) so I could utilize Party Mode and Stereo Mode, and then these are far better than they have any right to be. The bass shook through the house at about 40% volume, to the extent that my wife actually asked me to return one and get some noise cancelling headphones if I wanted to be blaring music all day. üòÇSo (for now), I‚Äôm obliging and returning one, but honestly, I don‚Äôt want to. One of these speakers are great. Two make a great portable stereo system.Now for the feature set. Key selling points for me were:1. Durability. It‚Äôs made of steel and silicone, is rated to withstand a dunk in water and dust. You can enjoy this in the yard, on your workbench, swimming, shower, etc. I live in high desert, and the wind blew over these speakers from a table to the ground and they didn‚Äôt have a single dent or scratch. Which leads me to‚Ä¶2. The device has sensors built in that detect its positioning, so the sound quality was maintained even if it‚Äôs on its back, side, or face down. None of the other products that compete in this segment offer that function to my knowledge.3. Unlike other products that I considered, this sounded good right out of the box. Anker (Soundcore) offers some great competition in this segment, but needs the EQ tweaked to shine. They‚Äôre not bad by any means, but I wanted things to just be simple. Power on and go without fuss. Bose delivered that.There are similar products for sure. Ultimate Ears will also let you pair two portables to create a stereo, but it lacked the intelligence that this speaker did.We already covered Soundcore. Tweak with the EQ, save some money, you‚Äôll likely be happy.These speakers do often go on sale, and I purchased mine used (like new) and refurbished respectively. The ‚ÄúUsed‚Äù unit was actually brand new from Amazon, broke the seals on the box and everything. Far as I could tell, the speaker just rolled around in someone‚Äôs trunk unopened before returning. The box had some cosmetic damage but no dents, broken seals, and all accessories were obviously also unopened.Refurbished unit came straight from Bose. Also came with all accessories and literature, just a box that was labeled ‚ÄúRefurbished‚Äù. Warranty on refurbished or new are 1 year regardless.I bring this up to encourage you to save some money, reduce some e-waste, and buy secondhand like I did. No judgments if you want to go new of course! But I got 2 speakers, one that was new in reality, essentially $100 off the set, and I didn‚Äôt miss out on anything in terms of product or warranty.$150 is pricey for a speaker, but $103 for a Bose speaker is not. Especially one that can literally go for a swim.Four criticisms I‚Äôd like y‚Äôall to know. First, compression above about 75% volume. Your bass will flatline above this point to maintain clarity of the track as a whole. In reality, that just means you go from a slightly warm tone to a very neutral tone of sound profile. No big deal unless you‚Äôre blasting EDM, Hip-Hop, the like. As I said, this little 20W speaker carries enough punch that 70% was more than enough to fill my backyard.Second criticism is no biggie for me, but worth bringing up for those shopping the competition. I didn‚Äôt want to fuss with an EQ, but competitors do have them to fine tune your sound. Consequentially, the app is basically useless beyond seeing your battery life and an option on how to do party mode (not required).Third criticism is truly a nitpick, but why do I have two apps for my Bose products? Why do I need one for headphones and one for speakers? Wish Bose would put all their portable speakers and headphones into one app. You could easily knock out criticisms 3-4 by just putting this speaker into the Bose Music app, like my QuietComfort Headphones, and this VERY speaker's big brother, the Soundlink Flex Max, is already there. Why the heck is the Soundlink Flex not in Bose Music, with a basic EQ like the others?Fourth, this uses outdated Bluetooth. No big deal. Pairs easily. But don‚Äôt expect to watch movies or game off of this. Latency is too high.Anyhow, enough of that. Go buy one. Or better yet, two. You won‚Äôt be disappointed.","Reviewed in the United States July 2, 2024",AH5F7QHDE5VKRAMBN43A5WPU4ADQ,True,120,Color: Black

I‚Äôm not going to lie, I had low expectations and planned on returning it. After opening it and setting it up, I got to see what the hype was about. Took me a couple hours of listening to figure out if it was a bang for my buck or a waste of money.I currently have the first UE Megaboom that I use daily that I bought back in 2016. It‚Äôs loud, has bass and can fill a room. Sadly, the charge isn‚Äôt exactly reliable so I was looking for something new. The Bose Link Flex definitely has a great quality sound. It will definitely fill a room. I like to use mine in the shower and acoustically in the shower the bass just sounds amazing!! Speaker actually fell off the shelf from the bass and survived the fall.Now, I listen to just about every genre of music. I found it to sound best with Latin music. Vocals are super clear. When it came to rap music (or music with lots of bass) I found it to sound perfectly balanced when the volume was at about 75%. Above that you‚Äôll definitely still get volume but the bass will take a seat back. I‚Äôm used to the UE Megaboom that has 360 sound. While the Bose Link Flex will fill a room, the sound seems more straight forward depending if you want to stand it up or lay it down.Bose App is decent. Doesn‚Äôt really have any equalizer setting on there if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre loooking for.I got this because it is small enough to pack in a carry on and not take up too much space in my bag. Might I add, it‚Äôs almost the same size as my iPhone 14 Pro Max . I can easily carry both in one hand. Easy to say, I‚Äôm going to keep this speaker with me.

RTTQUD9NY9L3G,B099TJGJ91,5.0 out of 5 stars Way better than expected!,Rich,5,"The last time I tried Bose speakers was about 25 years ago and I swore them off completely because I didn't like their signature sound. After reading all of the glowing reviews and watching many, many speaker reviews on YT, I decided to give the Soundlink Flex a try as a replacement for my aging Sony SRS-X3. I initially purchased the Beosound A1 (2nd Gen), which has superior mid and high sound quality IMO, but had to return because the it was very underpowered. Where the Flex can easily fill a 500 sq ft space, the A1 provided incredibly low sound at a distance of 15 ft. The Flex puts out more bass, if not more than the A1, and the bass offers more punch at lower Hz than the A1. The overall sound is great for the price but would be really nice if the app included an equalizer to help push up the mids and highs.Prior to purchasing the Flex on Amazon and trying to save a buck, I bought the Flex SE from Costco thinking it was the same product that was just repackaged. After 15 minutes of trying to use as a speakerphone, I finally figured out that the SE does not have a built-in microphone and therefore cannot be used as a speakerphone. So, I immediately returned the SE and bought the non-SE here.","Reviewed in the United States September 3, 2024",AHWOBQMLF2N4Z4TCEPMHAL4ASVHQ,True,0,Color: White Smoke
R3TVEXDLBORXWI,B099TJGJ91,5.0 out of 5 stars 5 Million Stars!! ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê,Caitriona Gillespie,5,"OMG this is the best speaker which is not a huge floor speaker (over 1 foot high) that is part of a massive speaker system. The sound quality is truly impressive for a speaker of any size, & I think that if I bought another one, which I'm seriously considering, it would rival my Kenwood stereo system, which has two floor speakers that are over a foot high each, & the Kenwood amplifier, & the Kenwood 5-CD player. All that stuff is so big that it needs its own cabinet & takes up several feet of floor space. I don't know how the geniuses at Bose have done it, but they have somehow packed all that sound into a speaker less than half the size of a loaf of bread that is also a very appealing shade of lilac that goes with my d√©cor. The Bluetooth connection works perfectly every time, even though I don't have the newest phone out there. I'm so in love with this speaker, the only complaint I have is purely aesthetic & easily fixed- the fabric loop attached to this beautiful lilac speaker is, for some unknown reason, an entirely ridiculous shade of brilliant orange, which clashes hideously with everything. I solved this problem with a dark purple Sharpie marker. That is the only complaint I have. While this speaker comes without any instructions on how to set it up, the set up is so easy, even when you're not a technology person, that I set it up myself with no help in under a minute. I plugged it in, turned it on, turned the volume all the way up- for some idiotic reason, it comes with the volume all the way down- & then turned on the Bluetooth on my phone & had it search for Bluetooth devices. My phone found the speaker very quickly, paired with it without issue, & started playing. One important thing to know is that when you leave the range of the speaker for an extended period of time, like when I leave for work & take my phone with me, the speaker will turn that connection off, so that when I get home & want to use my speaker again, I need to go over to the speaker with my phone & push the power button once. The speaker will say how much battery power is left & that it is now connected to my phone- I don't turn the Bluetooth off on my phone when I leave the house. I recommend turning the speaker all the way up & then controlling the volume through your phone, which is what I do. I think that's the easiest way to do it. One charge of the battery lasts a long time- at least 12 hours, so that part's great as well. Just buy it already, you won't regret it. It'll beat the pants off of all of your other speakers, even if you already have a nice set of Bose speakers.","Reviewed in the United States June 15, 2024",AGKOCRUHY2FG2ZHWTZRUH5JYIFBA,True,26,Color: Chilled Lilac
R2TT1UU35P8I2W,B099TJGJ91,"4.0 out of 5 stars Surprisingly loud, no EQ controls, few caveats",Jacob Teeler,4,"Bought this for work (I run a forklift and JBLs just arent loud enough) and was pleasantly surprised by how loud it gets. Sound quality is fantastic at all volume levels, its durable and holds up pretty well to the elements. The battery does genuinely last a full 8-10 hour shift playing constantly. A few things to note however.There are no EQ controls for it. Sound is well balanced but theres no bass boost, treble, no nada built in.The app is unnecessary once you get it set up with your device, really only need it to check the battery. The speaker will tell you what its battery percentage is if you turn it off and on though.Max volume is entirely dependent on the device its paired to. If i pair it to my PC, max volume is pretty quiet. If i pair it to my buddy's phone it gets pretty loud, but nowhere near as loud as it is paired to my phone.Volume controls are independent from the device and speaker. You can turn your speaker volume to max but your device is the primary control. So if you have the speaker on low volume and your phone all the way to the max, it wont be as loud as both at max, and vice versa. Its very odd.It does not remember the bluetooth volume of the device its paired to, so if you turn it off and use it the next day, it has a habit of being at full blown volume by default. Just be mindful.Other than that, its excellent and no one will be disappointed by it.","Reviewed in the United States July 22, 2024",AHEGWVGORT2NYKVPVFMFBFDUYI7Q,True,2,Color: Black

So it‚Äôs not surprising that they pack a lot of quality into this little speaker. For one thing, holds a charge a long time! And it announces each time it‚Äôs turned on how much charge is left. No guessing. The sound quality is really decent for the size of the speaker. It can get very, very loud, if that‚Äôs your thing. It has a bass booster that I usually leave on. I appreciate that it is water resistant as I take this into the bathroom, the kitchen, camping, etc. It paired readily with my iPhone. There are some other features I haven‚Äôt played with yet, like doing my Teams meetings with it using the onboard mic, but I suspect it will be fine. If you are looking for a reasonably small Bluetooth speaker with a big sound without breaking the bank, give it a try.","Reviewed in the United States August 4, 2024",AG4KHYIUPQPNTJR7JU5GD7DGV7QQ,True,1,Color: Cypress Green

I tried to return the item on Amazon, then saw a troubleshooting video. Open your 'systems settings' on your computer and select 'sound'; click the Bose option for speaker 'output'.

It tips over very easily as the base is rather narrow. Second, the battery life leaves a bit to be desired. It's not as long as other speakers I have had but it's decent. I wish the bright white/blue lights were red or could be turned off. It gives off just enough light to be bothersome if you truly need a dark room to sleep. Forget using the app, all it does is connect and you don't really need it to even do that. It wouldn't control anything on this speaker. Lastly, why is it talking? I don't need it to tell me the battery level or that my device is disconnected. I don't need it to speak at all. It's rather annoying bc if you disconnect and don't turn it off, it promptly reminds you. Spooked the hell out of me several times. It gets 4 stars bc audio wise it's absolutely on point as expected.

I don‚Äôt consider myself an audiophile, but I do listen to music religiously ‚Äî 100k+ hours annually ‚Äî and I can appreciate a crisp sounding speaker with nuance. This speaker lacks the nuance. It‚Äôs not terribly loud in my opinion, even on full volume in my small apartment. However, it is durable, and I love that it‚Äôs waterproof. Upon further research, I discovered that Bose is actually NOT worth the value for the money ‚Äî many audiophiles recommend purchasing from another brand, as these speakers can be made for less than $50 and sold for $400+. Initially I purchased the Bose Soundlink MAX and another Flex (product listed here) as well, in hopes of amplifying the sound as well as achieving stereo sound in my apartment.After doing some research, I returned the Soundlink Max and one of the Flex speakers as well. I purchased some ELAC speakers instead for HOME use, and kept one of the Bose Flex speakers for shower use and traveling, as I spend a lot of time on the beach and this is dust and drop resistant. I purchased this on Prime Day for $99 before tax. I would NOT say it‚Äôs worth $150 full price. The battery is not great. I can leave it charging overnight and it dies with moderate use before the day is over. Mediocre in performance overall.It‚Äôs worth nothing that when I purchased the Soundlink Max from Amazon, the box itself clearly states that the speaker comes from Bose ‚ÄúRETURNS AND REPLACEMENTS.‚Äù I believe the speakers sold on sale are probably speakers that were defected or returned by other customers.

Bass is smooth and solid, highs are bright and tight. Nice instrumental and vocal definition, and nicely audible stereo separation. This generates plenty of volume for small- to mid-size rooms, more than I need for the place where I use it.It pairs with my iphone quickly and reliably. Volume control from the phone works as it should. I tend to set the phone around mid-level and then use the speaker control to amp it up.What a nice design - old-school genuine wood, fabric, speakers on display, and nothing more. No flashing lights or gimmicks. Simple basic controls.I've been listening and tinkering with audiophile equipment for my whole life.

I‚Äôve also read pretty much every review on here, so I‚Äôll touch on some of the more frequent concerns.Sound quality: 1/5 very flat sounding with almost no bass and lackluster mids. Generally makes your music sound dull and lifeless. It does get fairly loud if you need it to, though. Acoustic music sounds alright, but that‚Äôs about it...Connections: 5/5 I‚Äôve had no issues with the Bluetooth or aux port on this. Never drops or cuts out from my apple or android devices. Sounds like QC is a bit problematic though, as lots of people have had issues in this department.Portability: 2/5 No covers for the speakers always makes me nervous when taking this anywhere. Just waiting for the day I get a pen through it or something.

RUL2NHT5AJZTD,B01IOD7KB6,2.0 out of 5 stars Disappointed in almost every way - Don't buy!,Danny,2,"Attracted the successful marketing/branding pitch (""House of Marley"") and by the numerous positive reviews, I decided to purchase this speaker, despite its relatively high price in a product category with a huge number of high quality competitors. This was a mistake, and I am quite disappointed. Except for its look and styling, which I like very much (except for the exceptionally large and bulky size and weight, which I don't), there is nothing else that I like about this speaker:Sound quality - very tinny, almost unpleasant. I often listen to podcasts, and the default sound quality borders on unlistenable. I have to manipulate the equalizer settings on my phone app to be able to listen, and I have to do this every time. Very annoying. The situation is only slightly better when listening to music. Even my little first-generation Oontz Angle sounds better! In fact, my experience is at such odds with the reviews, that I wonder if I have a defective product.Size: I knew when I ordered that this was a larger system than most others in its quality and price range, but I guess I should have looked more closely at the dimensions, which are, for a ""portable"" system, huge and heavy. Maybe some people like this - not me. Much too big, much too heavy.Battery life - haven't measured it, but it is MUCH shorter than any other portable bluetooth speaker I have owned, and this was true right out of the box.Connection and operation: it works okay, but is annoyingly non-intuitive.Conclusion: poor sound quality, too big, short battery life, non-intuitive operation. There dozens of alternatives that will give you much better quality and satisfaction, for a lot less money. Stay away from the House of Marley, at least this particular product.","Reviewed in the United States April 30, 2018",AEJUHFEP7FRKBCAMWYULJID43ITA,True,3,Color: Signature Black

Stay away!!So, I learned about this speaker cause a friend and I were at a new bar that had just opened and they didn't have their permanent speakers wired up yet. We saw this cool speaker, and both looked at each other and basically said, ""no way all this sound is coming from only this speaker!?"" And it was. I ordered one the next day. It's great, connects to BT on iPhone right away, range is on par with most better BT products, 30' +/-. Audio is very good for what it is, definitely above average. I also have a little Yamaha BT speaker (don't recall what model) and the Marley blows it away. I have heard some from JBL that sound good, the Marley is better.

R3AK5LLZ1VVTWJ,B08X4YMTPM,"5.0 out of 5 stars INSANE Speaker! Quality, volume, battery, and features make this THE BEST!",Jeremy,5,"The JBL Charge 5 is the BEST speaker I have ever owned. I have had the average run-of-the-mill bluetooth speaker that has around a $20 value, for over a year, and I thought it was good sound quality, and I never thought I needed something ‚Äúfancy.‚Äù Well, that speaker started having problems, and I was carefully searching for another speaker. I found this speaker and I thought I would try something new. I only had one thought as I played music out of it for the first time. WOW! The JBL Charge 5 has the best sound quality I had ever heard from a bluetooth speaker. I don‚Äôt ever plan on getting another speaker; that is, a speaker that isn‚Äôt JBL or an upgraded version of the Charge 5. The clarity is absolutely stunning! The bass is DEEP. I can feel the bass through my whole room! The volume is insane. I rarely have it over 50%, but in the event where I need it louder, I turn it up. I once had music filling a whole event center that was quite a reasonable size. If I could choose one word to describe this speaker, it would be ‚ÄúStunning,‚Äù ‚ÄúPowerful,‚Äù or ‚ÄúSupercharged!(Pun intended.)‚Äù On that note, the battery life on this thing is long! I once had the speaker provide some background noise for about two days and the battery life was barely lower than 70% (I think‚Ä¶it‚Äôs hard to tell exactly with the battery indicator; definitely above 60%). Of course, the battery drains quicker when you have the speaker playing at high volumes. Also, it can take some water. Some being a little, I prefer not to put it to the test. Here is my takeaway:DESIGN: 9/10 Great! I love the fabric covering. The JBL logo is made of metal, which makes it look very nice and official. The buttons are easy to distinguish, and the light is on the power, bluetooth, and there is a ring of light around those two buttons when PartyBoost is in effect. There is a battery bar right below the JBL Logo, and it serves as a general battery indicator. You can get the 100%, 75%, 50%, and 25%. You can get more info on the battery via the app. The weight is surprisingly light, considering the volume this speaker is capable of. Although, it isn‚Äôt the most portable of portable speakers as it is a little big and has a football shape. You can get a case for it that has a strap though. For the skip feature, you have to press the play/pause button twice. Make sure that when you do this, you maintain a consistent interval of time between the two presses. If you do it too fast it will just pause. If you do it too slow, it will just pause then play again.BATTERY: 10/10 Perfect! I absolutely love the battery. I‚Äôm the kind of person that prefers the longest possible battery, and doing whatever it takes to preserve it. I don‚Äôt have to worry much about this battery. Like I said, it has provided some low music for almost 2 days and the battery wasn‚Äôt that affected. However, the battery life will drain much more rapidly when using the speaker at high volumes. I currently use this speaker with a projector to watch TV. I have watched lots of movies and TV shows, and I don‚Äôt have to pay much attention to the battery. I just plug it in every other night, and it does great! And having a battery bank is the cherry on top. I haven‚Äôt used it much, as I keep most of my devices fully charged, but I think it is awesome that it has a battery bank if I need it.SOUND QUALITY: 10/10(10.5/10) Stunning! I didn‚Äôt expect that sound quality could get this good for a bluetooth speaker. JBL means business! When I turn it to high volumes, I can actually feel air blowing from it! On that note, it can go REALLY high in volume. I did not expect that at all. Insane volume. As stated earlier, I use this with a projector, and for all my TV. Watching movies with this speaker makes the entire experience cinematic! A much bigger upgrade compared to the sound TV‚Äôs come with. I would even say that it can contend with some soundbars out there (not the JBL Surround Sound System though‚Ä¶that one seems like the top-tier of JBL). This speaker was my first experience with JBL speakers (other than the car speakers) and I was very impressed. It has been the best sound experience I have ever had. Really clear and crisp audio, and when I say ‚Äúreally,‚Äù I mean truly! When playing music, I can hear every instrument, every breath, and incredible bass. The bass is a superstar in and of itself. Like I said, the bass shakes my whole room when playing music, and when watching movies! The side radiators really, really pack a punch! There is even an adjustable EQ on the app. Though I prefer what the speaker came with. It is a little pricey, (just a little) but know that you get what you pay for! I don‚Äôt think that I can ever go back to what I had‚Ä¶PARTYBOOST: 9/10 Great! I had one, so I bought two more so I could create a surround sound with my TV. It kinda worked. I think I had some sort of connectivity issue, so all I‚Äôll say is that the range might not be that great, so make sure you keep them somewhat close. If you have a projector that has bluetooth and you want to use PartyBoost, I would consider researching what you can do with the Bluetooth latency (As stated earlier, I watch TV with this, and please note there IS some lag between sound and video, as bluetooth will do. However, that is just bluetooth technology, not JBL. Over time my ears and eyes have adjusted, and now it is not that big a deal). In addition to standard bluetooth latency, PartyBoost will make this delay greater (I ended up returning the other two because of this issue). For music, this is not a problem, because it is just sound and no video. With music, PartyBoost is pretty cool! It really creates a much louder and much cooler sound experience. You can even use just two for a stereo effect, and it works great!Overall, this has been the BEST bluetooth speaker experience I have ever had. You better believe I‚Äôll be there for the Charge 6 or 7 or wherever they decide to take this. They really have something good going here. I would 110% recommend this! If you are reading this review, and you would like an upgrade to your typical listening experience, know that this is one of the best out there! And if you catch this at a discounted price, you‚Äôll know you are getting a great deal. JBL has been the best listening experience for me. I will continue buying their products if they keep supplying a high-quality experience. I mean, let the 27,000 ratings with a 4.8 overall rating speak for itself. Here is a simplified pro-con list:PROS-Excellent audio clarity-Excellent bass-Excellent overall sound-Exceptional volume-Long battery life-Battery bank feature-Waterproof feature-Adjustable EQ-Stereo Effect-PartyBoost for multiple speakersCONS-Button timing for the skip track-Could be slightly more portable (We do have the Flip speakers for that though)","Reviewed in the United States April 5, 2024",AEDM32EKQE2HOHUCSXFF2Z27F7NQ,True,78,Color: Black
R158T5SJCSV7IQ,B08X4YMTPM,5.0 out of 5 stars Amazing Sound and Great Durability,Miguel Gomez,5,"The media could not be loaded. I recently got my hands on the JBL CHARGE 5 Portable Waterproof Bluetooth Speaker, and I have to say, it‚Äôs been an awesome addition to my music setup. Whether I‚Äôm chilling at home, heading to the beach, or just hanging out in the backyard, this speaker has been delivering on all fronts.First off, let‚Äôs talk about the sound quality. It‚Äôs impressive! The audio is clear and crisp, making everything from podcasts to my favorite tracks sound fantastic. The bass is particularly noteworthy ‚Äì it‚Äôs deep and punchy without being overwhelming. I‚Äôve had other portable speakers before, but this one definitely stands out in terms of delivering that full, rich sound we all crave.The build quality of the JBL CHARGE 5 is also top-notch. It feels solid and durable, which is exactly what you need in a portable speaker. I‚Äôm not the gentlest person with my gadgets, so knowing this speaker can withstand a bit of rough handling is a huge plus. The waterproof feature is a game-changer too. I‚Äôve taken it to the pool and the beach, and it‚Äôs held up perfectly fine even after getting splashed. No worries about a bit of water ruining the fun.Another awesome feature is the battery life. With up to 20 hours of playtime, this speaker keeps the party going all day and night. And the powerbank USB charge-out is a lifesaver! I can charge my phone on the go, which is super handy during long outings or when I forget to charge my phone beforehand. JBL PartyBoost is another cool feature that lets you pair multiple JBL speakers for an even bigger sound. I haven‚Äôt tried it yet, but it sounds like a blast for larger gatherings.Honestly, I‚Äôve struggled to find any real cons with this speaker. It‚Äôs a bit on the heavier side, but considering the sound quality and battery life, it‚Äôs a trade-off I‚Äôm happy to make. The price is a bit higher compared to some other portable speakers, but you‚Äôre definitely getting what you pay for in terms of quality and performance.In conclusion, the JBL CHARGE 5 is a fantastic portable speaker that‚Äôs worth every penny. With clear, clean sound, excellent bass, and high-quality materials, it‚Äôs perfect for anyone looking to amp up their music experience. Whether you‚Äôre an audiophile or just someone who loves good tunes on the go, this speaker won‚Äôt disappoint.

R20JW8VDOEC2BP,B08X4YMTPM,5.0 out of 5 stars Perfect Mid-range Bluetooth Speaker,REDBLINKER,5,"This speaker is my 3rd JBL. I first bought the JBL Pulse 5 speaker awhile back, and I really love that one, especially for the light show it can do, but it's a little large to pack up and haul. Then I bought the JBL Flip 6 which is smaller, but still can pack a nice punch... but only if you turn it up really loud. I really love the JBL Flip 6 because it is extremely portable, but I decided that I wanted to try this JBL Charge 5 because I love the camouflage pattern on it, and it seemed like a good in-between speaker from the other two speakers I'm comparing here. As it turns out, the JBL Charge 5 is the best choice for me in terms of portability, and sound. It's got a really nice full sound, and I don't have to turn it up quite as loud as the JBL Flip 6 to achieve the full sound I like. That means to me that I have more volume to play with if I really jam out to some good music. In the future I would like to try the JBL Extreme, even though I know it's not as portable as these other speakers I have. Anyway I really love this JBL Charge 5, and I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a bluetooth speaker that can get loud, but offers easy portability.","Reviewed in the United States June 24, 2024",AFE42LBIADDXKHZ66MQRD7DE7JYQ,True,2,Color: Camouflage

R3B50FJN1UU9BC,B08X4YMTPM,3.0 out of 5 stars Audio Engineers point of view,Christo,3,"I purchased two of these to work as a stereo pair in my apartment to obtain a nice full sound without having to really crank the volume to have an enjoyable experience and bother the neighbors.Well it all started out great, the white look clean and are small enough to not take up too much visual space. They also sound fantastic for a battery powered speaker, relatively full low end and crisp highs without needing to be EQed. They are setup roughly 15‚Äô feet from one another in opposing corners of my studio space. They add presence and a fullness that I was missing from my Notabrick Bluetooth speakers.Now for THE PROBLEMS:I synced the speakers together and switched them to ‚Äústereo‚Äù mode from the app with no problem using my iPhone 13 Pro running Bluetooth 5.1. When it was time to connect it to my stationary media hub it was intended for (a 2020 iPad 8th gen) it would only connect one speaker and not allow for a party link or stereo link between the two Charge 5‚Äôs anymore. It took my some time of testing and no help from the internet to find out that the Bluetooth 4.2 that the iPad uses means the JBLs could no longer connect in a pair. I figured they had their own connection protocol (perhaps wifi 2.4ghz) for party mode. This shared audio functionality will ONLY work if your device that is sending audio is Bluetooth 5.1.SECOND ISSUE:So I put the iPad aside and would only be using my iPhone for music since that‚Äôs the only way I could get the Stereo mode to function. But after 15-30 minutes of music playback the speakers will disconnect themselves from one another requiring you to manually go to them and reconnect themselves. Every third time or so they will also drop the Bluetooth connection requiring you to ‚Äúforget device‚Äù on your phone and resync Bluetooth to your host Charge 5 and then relink the speakers.This is all to say that if you want to use more than one speaker, even using a compatible Bluetooth 5.1 device that they are extremely finicky. Using a single Charge 5 has proved to be very reliable, sound great and look great. I am an audiophile and have many thousands of dollars in pro audio.The current tested Firmware version is 0.8.6.0 and has not been updated for over a year so this is unlikely to be fixed.UPDATE: I purchased two Charge 4 speakers to run through all the same testing and scenarios as the newer Charge 5 Models and found that with the exception of the occasional dropout and auto reconnection (perhaps once every two hours or so) these have solved all my issues. In fact, having the Aux plug on this model has also meant I can plugin my DJ decks to them when we are at the park and the primary speaker that is being plugged into will duplicate the signal and send it to the second speaker wirelessly with no issues. There is about one second of lag with this setup so the use of my DJ headphones is a requirement, but I love the added functionality. I also find the battery meters to be much more easy to read on the Charge 4. Finally, I do not know if it's because the transmission power of the Bluetooth 4.2 in the Charge 4 over the Bluetooth 5.1 in the Charge 5, but I find that I get a longer transmission range with no dropouts with the older Charge 4 model. On paper this should be backwards but testing 4 independent units in different scenarios have shown this to be recurring findings for me. I have used the 2020 iPad, iPhone 13 pro and Macbook M1 pro and a HD Firestick as my test subjects.I do notice that the Charge 5 has a slight edge in real world testing for maximum volume and clearly has a crisper high end to it where the Charge 4 sounds a little more round but is still very pleasing to the ear. I suggest to save a ton of money and pickup the Charge 4 if you are planning on using them in a multi speaker setup like me.","Reviewed in the United States December 15, 2023",AE5UFAYXB2EX2T4NQ5HFHWATP6NA,True,22,Color: White
R1D9I181C4INKE,B08X4YMTPM,5.0 out of 5 stars Great little speakers,The pc builder,5,So let start off by I‚Äôm old school when it comes to selecting speaker. I have a massive surround system that sound great! I stumbled across the little speaker by accident. So I was doing a cell phone upgrade and they asked if I wanted a Bluetooth speaker versus 2 wireless stands‚Ä¶ I opted for the Bluetooth speaker as I had 2 wireless stands that work great. So I hooked this little flip 6 up and was amazed by the sound of this little thing. So I was doing a bit of research and finding that I could hook other speakers. So I opted to pick up another flip 6 and put them into stereo mode. I was floored by the sound out of these little speakers and the stereo field was amazing too!!! So then I was wanting to see how the charge 5 would stack up and then combine them. The one charge 5 has an edge on the bass but the mids and highs of the flip 6 held there ground and sounded a bit better to me. Now I starting thinking of 2.1 sound and this is where everything just shined very bright. Have the best of both worlds highs mids and lows in 3 small speakers!!! Some of the music that I demonstrate in this set up was Rush - The Weapon.. this has some really nice percussion section with some stereo left to right separation. I also played Led Zeppelin‚Äôs- Stairway To Heaven for the same reasons or the stereo left to right separation and over rounded sound. Great news it passes with flying colors and I give these 5 stars all day long. I‚Äôd like to pick up the extreme 3 and give it a go in this set up as it has the AUX jack that would make it useful enough to hook up external AM/FM with USB and SD card. In closing don‚Äôt overlook these speaker I really enjoy my little speaker and I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll love too!!!!,"Reviewed in the United States February 19, 2024",AFPGGENH3QGVQQIBUDQY26SDVVKA,True,3,Color: Black

RL16ZWDRDNUEI,B09XXW54QG,5.0 out of 5 stars Great product with usage caveats,Omar Enrique Ferrer,5,"A few months ago I had an epiphany. When I was a kid my father loved to have the best in sound equipment in the house, and I would play with graphic equalizers and lay in the floor looking for the best position between the giant speakers to experiment how to better enjoy the music.Today, I hear music in monophonic audio in an old JBL Charge 3 speaker (don't tell my dad, he would be ashame of me).So I started to get better equipment. Now, I live in a small apartment with thin walls in a 3rd floor, so, big amplifiers and so are out of the question, but at least I could get better bluetooth speakers, so I tried the Marshall Emberton II.To say that I impressed with the sound would be an understatement. With out-of-the-box settings, the sound is more than detailed. 80s and 90s music sound outstanding although, Peter Cetera's Glory of Love and Toto's Africa vocals sound as I never heard them before, they are sharp and strong, sometimes detracting just a little from the overall sound (keywords here, really, just a little).This brings me to my first recommendation: do not mess with your applications equalizers if you don't know what you are doing. This speakers were clearly designed to use the manufacturer equalizer settings (more on this later). I have youtube music and amazon prime music (yeah, I know, no spotify), and my sound with the latter was to heavy on bass, to the point of drowning the music and feeling almost distorting. Tron: Legacy's soundtrack sounded specially dreadful, as Daftpunk uses heavy bass in their electronic music for that specific music. I then set the equalization in Amazon Prime Music to flat. It was a different performance altogether. I could ever hear some slight effects they used, that I had not noticed before.Now, one down for the application. Bluetooth pairing used Google Fast Pair, which was seamless and impressive (it shows appears to be a custom Marshall little window, so, it looks cool), but the application takes forever to actually ""discover"" the device, even when it is already paired.When it finally discover it (which was not too long, but took a couple of turning on and off the speaker), the application notified me of a firmware upgrade, which I proceeded to install. The installation failed miserably, so, I temporarily stopped that effort, which I retook successfully a day later. The update was surprisingly big in size, taking around 5 minutes to download, and the application simply marked the update successful while the speaker was still rebooting, which took a few seconds more than what I feel comfortable with, but it went through, and after that, the application again took surprisingly long to detect the speaker.To end that topic, the equalization settings are definitely underwhelming, with only three modes: Marshall, Voice and Push, of which I have only tried Marshall as everybody else says that Voice is just for podcast and such and Push increases bass at the expense of all the other sound bands quality.Lesson learned: unless too picky, when using this speaker, leave your apps equalizers on flat, their profile is that good.Now, to the hardware itself, people will notice this little wonder. Using the nostalgia factor with the Marshall amplifier design was a touch of genius, and the brass button on top is the cherry on top. Some reviews complain about a single button approach to multifunction (power, volume, forward-back, bluetooth pairing has another almost invisible button, which fits because you are not changing your pairing frequently). If we can handle touch control on over-head and in-ear speakers, this button is a piece of cake.My only complain in this department is that, at least for me, an old guy, the signs indicating the functions around the button, being carved in the black speaker, which has texture, are for all intent and purposes invisible, but once you get accustomed, an use the logo as a positional reference that's not a problem anymore.And finally, the little caveat. Single speaker, stereo sound. Let that sink in.Done? Ok, they achieve this trick by separating the sound left and right with drivers back and front respectively (or was it the other way around? well, you get my point). Stereo suffers a little (not too much) because both sources are incredibly close, but it brings this caveat. This speaker should not be set as others, against walls, like in shelf, and so, because you end up drowning one side.The best position for this speaker is in the center of the audio stage, and if you want to appreciate the sound, you should point one side (not the front or back) to you. that way both sources are equally distanced from you so you get a better balance.If you are ok with the caveats this product is worth the price, I definitely recommend it.","Reviewed in the United States October 1, 2022",AEFUDKDNGZTOEP2BCFB4CLUELCYQ,True,166,Color: Black & BrassStyle: Emberton II

R1PKWJ1ZABTB2S,B09XXW54QG,"5.0 out of 5 stars Love, love, love, and love...",Su Doki,5,"So good, I bought two instead of one Marshall Middleton. As wanted, I pair them together to get surround sound, smaller size, and save about $50. Although I own two pairs of Marshall headphones which I'm taking with me to Heaven, at that time - it took awhile for me to commit to buying the speakers. That's because I already own a pair of off-brand Bluetooth speakers that sound so much better and lasts many hours longer than more expensive Beats, Bose, Sony, etc. They have all the other bells-and-whistles specifications, including USB-C, rapid charging, 20+ hours playtime and only cost $30 each. The seller stopped selling them on Amazon.Emberton II was a huge jump in price. The difference from Emberton I - is it will pair with other Marshall speakers. But only the latest models like the Middleton or more Emberton IIs. Also, the Emberton II has a grain texture finish. The hardest part about buying Marshall products is knowing if you actually got authentic products. Knock-offs provide knock-off quality and it hurts the reputation of genuine products with bad reviews. I won't describe the differences in great details. The box is printed on all sides that spills over to other sides. It looks and feels real money, very expensively printed. Inside packaging and booklets too. The speaker is very well crafted down to the smallest details and feels solid. The grills are finished very well, individually, without any rough edges or mistakes and so is the Marshall signature emblem. Look closely.The Emberton II sound quality is phenomenal for all music genres. It's a work of art pumping out sound, spatially separating all the tracks of instruments and voices, to hear them together in one song. This is studio quality at a reasonable price. It exceeds my $30 pair, which already beat-out all the other more expensive speakers, in the only way it could. I heard sounds playing in music I've heard so many times, I can replay it verbatim in my head. Some folks might scoff at this price point comparison. But if I'm completely satisfied at $30 or $170 - no one can entice me to spend $1500 or $15,000 I can afford to pay too. I might purchase more Emberton II's to install wireless speakers throughout the house. For now, I'm pretty satisfied.","Reviewed in the United States March 29, 2023",AFG3MMBXL5ODHUR3EXHWYGOHLNXA,True,22,Color: Black & BrassStyle: Emberton II
R1N4D4CK1JMIVB,B09XXW54QG,4.0 out of 5 stars Three + 1/2 stars.,Sophie's6,4,"Feels churlish to give just three stars. 3.5 imo. So to the point. I bought this Em II to mainly listen to my true crime podcasts in my bedroom. Easy & seamless Bluetooth connection to my iPhone 14max. Easy straightforward use for controls on the unit. I really didn‚Äôt need to look at the instructions with that. Smooth use there.To test the sound quality I streamed some mesic. The sound quality for music is fine‚Äôish considering the size of speaker. It‚Äôs fine for background music if you‚Äôre flexible on sound quality as long as you don‚Äôt play loudly, at that point the music will frazzle out. So limited, not surprising. Podcast quality is definitely an improvement from my phone‚Äôs speaker and in line with the price point, in general. I think it should be about $25 less. The app is useless. I guess I expected something from the app. I‚Äôm at a loss for the point of it. I tried it out on my phone. It continued so say my phone Bluetooth was not on. Even as I was literally playing music through it. I did all the stuff. Restart, reconnect etc. Reviewed the booklet, Nothing. Everything re the speaker and phone working fine. But what is the point of the app? I interpreted from the manual that I should download the app to get extra features. Maybe bass and treble controls? The book claims you can stack more speakers through the app but I would not invest in that as it continually says my phones Bluetooth is off. lolFine retro look, sturdy, small footprint and working out for podcasts. Do not think the app is or will be helpful.If I were to try another I‚Äôd probably go with the Klipsch of similar design. It‚Äôs approximately $50 more but better sound and working app.Remove $25 dollars off price on the Em II and it‚Äôs a fair deal.","Reviewed in the United States February 28, 2024",AHIQF7PWHKOE36B564CMAEITLRDQ,True,11,Color: Black & BrassStyle: Emberton II

Really glad I didn't get the larger one which would no doubt sound great but would not be small enough to take it anywhere.","Reviewed in the United States July 30, 2024",AFE2C7YXKXETSNSRKZEYSS6VTLNA,True,2,Color: Black & BrassStyle: Emberton II
R3JMLBD2NPCVJ2,B09XXW54QG,5.0 out of 5 stars Best Yet Bluetooth Speaker,Stephen R. Finney,5,"This Bluetooth is head an shoulders above any JBL, Altec, or Bose Bluetooth speaker I've yet heard. The bass while strong, is not ridiculous, and muffled. What blew my mind is that I could hear the snare on a drum! No Bluetooth speaker I've had before could make a snare drum sound right. The speaker also has great volume. I may have more to add once I've had it for a while, but as of this moment I'm genuinely impressed. I will be buying at least one for a present for a sibling. As of this moment I'm recommending this speaker to anyone wanting a moderately priced, great sounding Bluetooth speaker.","Reviewed in the United States August 7, 2024",AEDSWRKYFHF5GREKQVNC3WKH3S7Q,True,4,Color: CreamStyle: Emberton II
RVQU04O5Y7EP5,B09XXW54QG,4.0 out of 5 stars Rich sound - with the right music,Brett Williams,4,"What I liked most about this unit was the dual driver system where you can get a more stereo sound than other Bluetooth speakers that are more mono (unless you pair a few together). The battery lasting up to 30 hours is impressive, though I didn't just it more than a few hours and couldn't speak to what real-time is. The top metal multi-directional button is very nice and premium feel......however the textured top/rubber surround makes reading the Volume/Track directions virtually impossible to see - you get used to it, but it would be nice if they were a little more visible.I will say that I'm disappointed in 2024, we're still seeing devices with Bluetooth 5.1, considering that it was released in 2016 and 5.3 has been out since 2021.With the driver's front and back-firing, I found that I got a wider sound by turning the unit sideways so that I was looking at the side of the unit while the drivers fired left and right.I listen to just about anything, and other were songs where the speaker excelled, but then others where it sounded very flat, and it's because of the inconsistency that I returned it. I will say that I liked it much more than the JBL's that I tested against which had almost zero depth comparatively, but for a little more I got something that, while larger, has a better sound presence.I was tempted to keep this as an alternative, but I think over time I would probably get annoyed with some songs sounding flat and others very deep and rich (or course tracks and recording quality matter, but compared to other speakers I tested I didn't see as big of a swing between the same songs).","Reviewed in the United States June 5, 2024",AEZLB3QWTROAPNV3SIQVKNOFDS3Q,True,4,Color: Black & BrassStyle: Emberton II

This speaker is all you need to sync your music with a clear, superior sound boost. I remember the Marshall amps for my punk rock days. This is a replica of the Marshall amps and that's one of the reasons I chose this speaker. Sound quality has not been sacrificed and it is easy to use. It's all you need. I purchased this a week ago and bought another for my son this week. I will most likely purchase one for my hubby because he is using mine all the time, and yes we have different tastes in music. Look at others if you wish, or save time and get this little powerhouse, Marshall.","Reviewed in the United States July 7, 2024",AEAF6N7CEGGH6D4W7EZV3CTY2EIA,True,1,Color: BlackStyle: Emberton
R13A8CEV5KJI8M,B09XXW54QG,5.0 out of 5 stars So Cool...,John Farrell,5,"I visited a friend on Florida recently and he's building a new house. We went over there to enjoy a few cocktails, it won't be done until May 2024, and brought along his Bang & Olufsen bluetooth speaker and took turns playing songs with our phones while we enjoyed our adult beverages on the water. I don't seem to have the same opportunities to use a bluetooth speaker, but I was very impressed with the B&O speaker. It rocked. I came back to NJ and wanted to get one for myself. These things aren't cheap (the good ones anyway) so I decided I was going to get one during the Black Friday sales. The B&O software, that enables you to pair with their speaker, was a pain in the neck. They were hounding me and sending me e-mails and all the rest. I wanted another alternative. I watched several YouTube videos and was introduced to this Marshall bluetooth speaker. They had me at designing this relatively tiny speaker to look like a real Marshall speaker. Once I read enough reviews I took the plunge. I think I got it on sale for around $120 when all was said and done. It showed up two day later. I pulled it out of the package, charged it up and paired it with my phone. Hate me (or them), but the first song I played with Help On The Way/Slipnot! from Blues For Allah (Grateful Dead). Wow. Absolutely loved the sound and the look. Down the road I will look into either ""stacking"" another one (they have that ability) or just getting a bigger speaker for another potential setting, but right now this thing rocks. If you go camping or just wanted to eat lunch at an outdoor picnic table with some music, this is for you. I'm impressed. I was a bit surprised that it seems as though your phone volume max is also the speaker volume max, but that might be a function of me not understanding how bluetooth actually works. I was kind of thinking I could leave the phone on mid volume and let the bluetooth speaker provide the amplification juice. That doesn't appear to be the case, but it's plenty loud enough in a vacuum. It's a starter speaker so I don't expect it to compete with something an outdoor waterfall or heavy traffic or even a tailgate party where everyone is blasting their tunes, but I'm very satisfied short term. Buy with confidence.","Reviewed in the United States January 10, 2024",AFHFRU22UQRFPEVWBHQFXHBHVYWA,True,3,Color: Black & BrassStyle: Emberton II

R1EA1XXVYAUBNB,B09XXW54QG,"5.0 out of 5 stars A simple, solid speaker",L,5,"If you want great sound in a simple package, this bluetooth speaker will do the trick. Initially I found the control button kind of fiddly, but now that I have the hang of it I can manage it easily.Mostly I use this at home when watching movies or listening to the news with some music thrown in. A serious audiophile would probably want a speaker that allows for more control, but the sound profile suits my needs.I've had very little trouble with the speaker losing its connection. There are only a couple of spots in my apartment (~600 sq ft) where the connection breaks up; fortunately, the connection is solid everywhere else, particularly in those rooms where I mostly want to use it.Build quality feels good and solid, like it's going to hold up for a long time. The speaker did get a light spray of water on it one day when I'd left it on my balcony and it suddenly began to rain, but the speaker was just fine.Of course Marshall has a reputation for quality sound gear, but the price still feels a little high given how simple this is. However, if you can get it on sale (as I did) and bring the price down under $100, I think it's worth it.","Reviewed in the United States February 20, 2024",AE23D3SJBYXFUO7OXEAFXXTU2IPA,True,3,Color: BlackStyle: Emberton

Even though my daughter kept telling me to get a JBL.I love the look of this little Marshall, classic! But, I probably should have listened to my daughter.The sound is decent to good. There is no ability to toggle any sort of EQ. So the sound you hear, is the sound you get. The thing that I like least about this speaker is the function button. There is only one that you depress in N,S,E, and W for different abilities, but it is loose. It wobbles around like a loose tooth. I would prefer a nice tight button that snaps in each direction.

I mean, I've been forking out $250.00 and more for other speakers. But curiosity got the better of me, and boy, am I glad it did!

The lower rating is due to the speaker's inability to go to a really low volume that I wanted for it to be a low key speaker for the bedroom. Also, Marshall allows pairing of speakers to play the same sound, or in stereo, but that apparently is only for when you have two of the same speakers. I have one of their larger speakers that I love, so I was very disappointed that their app doesn't allow pairing of two of their speakers that aren't identical. If you don't care about really low volume music or pairing with a different Marshall speaker, I can't recommend this more highly.","Reviewed in the United States December 4, 2023",AGQUN3KJYYOJNSILZUNTYO2M6FBA,True,2,Color: Black & BrassStyle: Emberton II

Lots of soft rubber around all sides so it doesn't clunk around when placed on a surface. The sound, without the app, was clear, wide frequency response, deep bass, much richer than I expected for the price. I'd say it's comparable to any of similar size at twice the price. And the long play time comes from a 4200mAH battery, which is one reason for the good heavy feel. It works well in rooms up to about 15 x 15 ft, or outside on a table. Was easy to pair.

It sounds awful compared to my USB portable speakers that are 10 years or more old, it sounds awful compared to my soundcore 2 ear buds.Even after manually adjusting the EQ to remove most of the bass it still sounds a little to ""bassy"", when listening to audiobooks. When listening to music, it's the same, it constantly sounds like there's something is blocking the speakers, everything it clear enough to hear, but then a muffled effect is layered over everything. Playing songs with bass I absolutely had to turn off the bass boost or it overwhelmed the audio. The best audio I got for music was to set it to custom and leave the low frequency flat and raise the high frequencies, but then bass acted like it was being pushed through a mid range speaker with a low pass filter.You could get decent audio, including songs with bass, by selecting treble boost or voice for music, but it still sounds like there some sort of ""muffled"" audio overlay on the bass. I don't know how to describe it, it's like the speaker can't produce all the base frequencies, but then they're still there coming through the speaker.Anyway if you can get it on sale it's good enough, but I'd look for coming cheaper with clear highs or spend more for a better speaker.","Reviewed in the United States September 6, 2024",AG6EQ2JGRHU3FDJS34AY27P3P6YQ,True,0,Color: Black

R10IY2LKB5834P,B08BCHKY52,3.0 out of 5 stars A drop in performance from the previous version of this speaker,Zain Kazi,3,"After using the previous speaker throughout college and after graduating, I was looking forward to using the newest version of this speaker. Sadly, this speaker is a drop in quality compared to the old version.Sound QualityThe sound quality of this speaker is not really an improvement from the previous version, and regular notes sound slightly muddled, but it is not usually very noticeable. Music with words sounds good, bass quality is pretty good, but listening to something like classical music is where I notice the individual notes sounding a bit muddled. The speaker itself can get pretty loud though, which is a step up from the previous version.Battery PerformanceThe battery performance on this speaker lasts me about a week and a half of daily use. This is a significant drop from the previous speaker, which could last me a month of daily use before charging.Bluetooth ConnectivityI have less issues connecting to this speaker than I did with the previous one. With the previous version, issues could come up when I disconnected and reconnected. Haven't noticed those issues yet with this one. My biggest issue with this speaker is that there is a delay in the transmission from my phone to the speaker, so when I watch videos, the audio doesn't sync up with what is being displayed on my phone. This is incredibly frustrating as I watch a decent amount of clips, and never had this issue with the previous version.Overall, this is a nice speaker, but I don't think I would buy it again, and it's hard to justify it being worth the $55 price. The previous version was an absolute steak at $22. Paying over double the price for a slight increase in volume and not much else is absolutely not worth it in my opinion. The speaker is good as a budget speaker, but for $55, it's no longer a budget speaker, and you're better off buying something else.","Reviewed in the United States June 14, 2024",AFSNGVI7PXHZ633L6W2VI3ABFDOQ,True,2,Color: Blue

This setup has solved my problem and now I feel the sound is balanced for both monitors.I have 2 complaints.1) The Soundcore Anker speakers have very good bass, but they are lacking the high end sharpness. The need to make a Soundcore Tweeter,2) when I put the 3 speakers in Party Mode there is a very tiny lag between the 3 speakers.

Its sound and battery are a solid 5 stars for the price but there are 2 things holding it back. One is major and the other is trivial but still annoying1. The latency of about 350ms is bad for anything synced to video. Games, streaming, youtube, etc is all out of sync. I use VLC media player to counteract the latency by hastening the audio by 350ms for movies, but it's a real hassle to use glitchy browser plugins for streaming and forget about gaming.2. Minor issue, but the annoying audio tones it plays when powering on or off and then when connecting. This takes almost 10 seconds where it plays its little fanfare tones while totally drowning out your media. This takes entirely too long and this could have easily been accomplished with simple LEDs on the unit. Because of this, you cannot listen to something from your internal speaker, then switch on the fly over to the Soundcore as you will lose about 10 seconds of audio while doing so.","Reviewed in the United States February 7, 2024",AF5WAN4PNIFUE77XZFAFPGM2EGEQ,True,2,Color: Black

To this end, it functions wonderfully. If you are up close to the unit, it sounds beautiful. It has several pre-set EQ settings but you can also create a custom setting. Once you step away from it (5+ feet), the sound begins to thin out. The bass is almost non-existent. I don't have a big problem with because the size of the unit is realistically not supposed to produce big bass. The sound tends to 'clip' at higher volumes but again, this is not a big issue as I really just need it for background music and don't expect it to be the primary unit for a house party. Overall, this is a very neat little speaker. I like how it is dual channel so you get stereo sound from one tiny box. I would definitely purchase more of these once I buy more SIRIUS/XM receivers for other rooms in the house.

When I woke up, the wire felt very hot. I burned my finger on the plug disconnecting it. The USB port on the speaker is melted around the opening as seen in the picture. The side of the Bluetooth speaker was REALLY hot. You can see the cord was melted as well. I used an Anker wall charger while charging this. If I never took it off the charger in the morning before going to work, my house probably would have burned down. Afterwards, battery lasted probably four hours.

My first review was based on a connectivity issue which was noted by Anker and prompted them to contact me. They resolved the issue quickly and thoughtfully. I‚Äôve never had any company reach out like that.I‚Äôve always been intrigued by small things that perform in surprising ways. When Bluetooth speakers first became available I was intrigued; what quality of sound could be expected from small and unobtrusive speakers? I‚Äôve had a lot of fun finding out.Over the years I‚Äôve occasionally updated my Bluetooth speaker based on newer models becoming better and better, particularly with bass response. Lately I‚Äôve had a chance to listen to several current models in the $150.00 and below price range, including Sony, Bose, Tribit, JBL Flip 5, and Soundcore 3.The Soundcore 3 is the clear winner. The highs, mid range and bass are all impressive, but the bass response is really surprising. Many Bluetooth speakers sacrifice highs and mid range for a muffled, muddy bass, reducing the entire sound to an unsatisfying mess. Not so with the Soundcore 3 which provides very clear partitions between all ranges and a very, very clean bass. The first time I listened to a song with a low, bass drone, I couldn‚Äôt believe what I was hearing. It was a composition that I was familiar with. I didn‚Äôt know it had a bass drone before. As one online reviewer put it ‚ÄúThe Soundcore 3 should not sound as good as it does.‚Äù I couldn‚Äôt agree more.So yes, the Soundcore 3 is the best Bluetooth speaker available in the sub $150.00 range, by far. It‚Äôs small enough to be almost unnoticed in a room, but fills the room with very satisfying, rich sound.","Reviewed in the United States February 9, 2023",AHDBBL5Q3T4ZUL2ATUYYLKHTJNJA,True,20,Color: Black

On moderate volume I will forget to charge it 6 times and it will still play music for hours at a time. When I do finally remember to charge it it does take some time to charge but for the amount of time that I get out of each charge this really is a no brainer.The sound quality is great! Keep in mind it's about 7 inches long....so it's not got a huge woofer in it. They did a great job of designing a bass cabinet though. It does well especially considering its size.

I came across the Anker line of various speakers. I‚Äôve always been impressed with their mobile products, so I decided to look into their speakers. I ultimately decided on the Soundcore 3 for its bass and reportedly louder sound.Whoa was I impressed!First of all, out of the box, the speaker has a very luxurious feel to it. I was also happy with the size. It‚Äôs about 6‚Äù long and 2.5‚Äù tall and deep. Not very big, lightweight, and easily packable. Setup was the easiest thing ever. I literally just turned it on, selected ‚ÄúSoundcore‚Äù from my list of Bluetooth connections, and that was it, connected in less than 10 seconds.Next I started playing some music from Apple Music. The sound blew me away. Ok, it‚Äôs not a surround sound stereo system with perfectly tuned components or anything. But this speaker plays loud, clear music with a range of tone. Again, impressed. With the volume over halfway, it really bumps in the house. I haven‚Äôt taken it outside yet, but it‚Äôs perfect for inside. When I‚Äôm done using it, I just power down the unit. When I want to listen again, I turn it back on and it automatically connects.I‚Äôm very happy with this speaker and I look forward to lots of fun listening to music with it.","Reviewed in the United States July 21, 2023",AFXW2QSUCBU3WUAESLJOPN22S3PQ,True,17,Color: Black

R1M6CTM5ERWSPC,B08BCHKY52,3.0 out of 5 stars The Lows,Christian T.,3,"I loved this speaker for its form* factor and build quality. If you're looking for a speaker cheaper then a jbl flip 4 through 6 and the jbl clip 4 this is a fantastic option. It's pretty loud even in open environments and drowns out constant humming and buzzing noises in my workplace but not too loud to not hear your coworkers if they really wanted your attention.I personally listen to a multitude of genres on various speakers daily so i quickly get an idea of what sounds out of place, overblown, underwhelmed or broken pretty quickly. I liked the sound provided with the stock eq so long as i wasn't playing any tracks with heavy bass and that can be from any genre not just edm or rap. Playing (If You Could Read My Mind by. Gordon Lightfoot) on stock eq at roughly 60% volume and up causes the speakers to struggle producing everything under 70hz. It begins to either bottom out or straight up distort and that was present from day one with or without the updates on 2 separate units. I have presumptions but im not sure. Either the speakers are built too shallow and they really are bottoming out OR there isn't enough pressure in the cabin so this effect doesn't happen either way its extremely unpleasant and i had to* HEAVILY modify the eq just to get it to stop even then i could never play it past 80% without feeling like it was going to self destruct. The sound here is as follows, versatile but not absolute. Certainly not for productivity. Definitely would make a fantastic gift for a child or a parent, maybe someone that just wants to play music in a more quiet environment and lower volumes. This is 100% something to take with you bike riding, walking, running, hiking, around a store to play high pitch noises that annoy everyone in the store, play at low volumes to fill in quiet space, in a car for audiobooks or voice calls. Definitely something that you don't mind losing or getting destroyed or stolen i suppose. Id give it a 6/10 for a speaker this size and at this cost but genuinely hope improvements are made.","Reviewed in the United States October 2, 2022",AGR6UC2Y2P2MROBDBB5PFAAJKM7Q,True,10,Color: Blue

I purchased the Anker Soundcore 3 after being disappointed by the Soundcore 2‚Äôs muddy bass and non-existent mids. I read some reviews that indicated that this was definitely an upgrade over the 2. The reviews were correct. Aside from being close to the Soundcore 2‚Äôs general dimensions, build quality and weight, this was where the similarities end. They have upgraded to USB-C for charging and removed the 3.5mm Aux, as well as adding a strap holder for carrying the speaker around. The battery life is amazing, especially when running at lower volumes. However, the biggest game changer is the battery life. You just need to download the Anker Soundcore App from your devices App Store, then make sure you have the speaker paired. The app should recognize the speaker once you open it up and answer the various prompts. Then you will be able to control the EQ with 4 preset EQs, as well as the ability to create and save custom EQ sets for your own preferences. Without the app, you are strictly limited to the sound that comes out of the Soundcore 3 by default. The app is what truly makes this speaker feel more high than the current $50.99 price point, which is a good thing.

I had a Big Jambox which is also a great speakerphone, but it was too big for my home office desk and it needed a dedicated charger which is a big brick where the SC3 has a USB C port to charge it. I tested a couple smaller units notably the JBL Go2 (Which is a terrible speakerphone) but was pleasantly surprised by the Soundcore3 as they don't really advertise the microphone or how well it works. You can use the app to tune for voice frequencies so the voice quality is very good and the microphone works very well my voice quality is reported as very good. I do have a couple of negatives, 1) It DOES NOT MULTIPAIR, in other words it won't pair both my Phone and my PC at the same time which is really disappointing considering this is Bluetooth 5 device and second when I pair it to my phone for some reason it seems to mess with my Liberty headphones when I pair them up after using the SC3, I have to unpair and re-pair the headphones in order for them to work properly which is easily done but super odd nonetheless. Overall this thing won't blow your socks off with volume, but it sounds really good for a small unit and is a great speakerphone, I would highly recommend despite it's shortcomings.","Reviewed in the United States June 1, 2021",AESCAX6I7AZ4RBQGO2JU2W5YNRBA,True,5,Color: Black

R33QPBQE5Q8RST,B08BCHKY52,1.0 out of 5 stars Piece of junk,Matthew,1,"I have owned quite a few Soundcore products from Anker, great headphones, pretty good tws earbuds, and this has to be the sixth, I don't know, seventh bluetooth soundcore speaker I've purchased, and EVERY SINGLE ONE has developed this static-like buzzing noise. You can hear it when it's on, when it's unpaired, pairing, paired, music playing and not playing. The noise only goes away when it's off. It isn't a white noise artifact from transmission or recording or a ground issue, noise isn't causing unwanted vibrations either. I take care of my things, I don't abuse them, this one in particular I kept in a little case I bought for travel (only traveled with it once). Minimal use, never maxed out or blasted the volume. AND YET after about three weeks, to a month developed the same noise I experienced in several other Soundcore speakers. I work with audio equipment, I would say I am fairly capable in diagnosing and correcting audio issues or at least identifying the issue. It sounds like something internally is shorting or a manufacturing defect without me having taken it apart. Again, was never rough with it and a few of my friends have had the same exact issues with theirs, I should have listened to them when they said not to bother with these, but the reviews were too good to think it a persistent and constant issue. And oh boy was I wrong.By then the return window expired, going to reach out to customer service but for now I've been stuck with a 50-something dollar paper weight. The worst thing they can do is send another one. So done with their speakers.","Reviewed in the United States July 11, 2024",AHHH34PFU33JE5K5W5SPHHUD5IWA,True,1,Color: Black

The charging port was failing and I feel that it lived a happy life. Decided to buy this speaker during Amazon Prime days. Arrived fine, but after some music samples, it felt like the bass was lacking or flat with not great thumps.So a week or two later I went out and purchased a similar style competitor brand Tribit and WoW, oh my gosh was I right. The tribit hits and punches the bass really well, however, the Soundcore 3 is louder in volume but flat and not punchy in bass.Overall feelings I would have to lean towards Tribit for getting a cheap budget 14w speaker.Tribit > Soundcore 3Given this new knowledge, I am likely to buy the next model up the 24w Tribit to see if I can compensate on the volume and still get that bass punch .I totally expected more from Anker and Soundcore, but the missed on this version of speakers","Reviewed in the United States July 25, 2023",AGUXQ6TLWASKXRCA7WN64VNPW5FA,True,3,Color: Black

I'm far from an audiofile and even I can tell this thing sounds like a $50 speaker. It really lacks bass, even with Bass Boost on. While I don't understand the love for this speaker, I'm giving it 4 stars because it's a $50 speaker that performs like a $55 speaker.So as it goes back to Amazon, it'll pass my new UE Wonderboom 2 that everyone raves about.

I am changing my review to 5 stars to reflect the customer experience received and the general satisfaction with the product.I really enjoyed this speaker while it lasted. I never used it around water and never blasted it at full volume. The sound was good and crisp for the first few months or so. It deteriorated over time to the point that I cannot listen to anything at all without hearing a loud ""scratching"" noise coming from the left speaker. I wouldn't be as upset if Anker (the parent company of Soundcore) offered a decent warranty period for their products. In the US this (and all of their other products) come with a 3 MONTH warranty.

R3LYZE987ADOQH,B08MZZTH1N,5.0 out of 5 stars Tribit Stormbox Pro Versus Bose Soundlink Revolve.,Chris,5,"I have both of these speakers and am offering a comparison. These are my opinions for what they‚Äôre worth. The bottom line is that the Tribit Stormbox Pro is a better value than the Bose Soundlink Revolve.Sound:Both of these speakers provide excellent room-filling sound that is decidedly different. The Bose is more ambient with a mono feel, which it is. The bass and mid-range are good but there is very little in the way of high treble. For example, you probably won't hear that classic ""ping"" in middle of ""Comfortably Numb"". Bose, being Bose, provides no information about what is inside the casing. My guess is that there is one woofer and a single transducer.Tribit, on the other hand, emits more of a surround sound which actually seems stereophonic. Bass is thumping amazing with the booster on, mid-range is fine and and very high notes come through loud and clear. Some reviewers describe this as ""Tinny""; I don't think so. Tribit openly discloses that there is a subwoofer, 2 transducers and 2 passive radiators.ADVANTAGE: Tribit. At lower volume, the sound quality is equal. Tribit wins at moderate to high volume with the Extra Bass activated.Functionality:Bose has 5 control buttons (Power, Bluetooth pairing, volume + and -, and one more which I haven‚Äôt figured out but things get messed up whenever I push it. An audio cable port is provide if you can‚Äôt connect via Bluetooth for some reason. The optional Bose charging cradle is the worst accessory ever designed in history - don‚Äôt waste your money. Bose rates the speaker as IP55 water resistant.Tribit has 4 buttons (Power, Bluetooth pairing, and volume + and -). The Tribit also shows battery power. The Stormbox Pro has a carrying strap which is a great idea; I‚Äôve dropped my Bose a couple times. Tribit rates the speaker as IP67 water proof.ADVANTAGE: Tribit. The controls are simpler.Price:Right now, the Bose Soundlink Revolve (Series II) is $219 and the Tribit Stormbox Pro is $119.95 with a 20% coupon ($95.96).ADVANTAGE: Tribit. Bose is over-priced.Appearance:The Bose exterior is solid plastic and durable. Tribit has a high-quality fabric exterior and looks good. The Stormbox is 1‚Äù higher than the Revolve.ADVANTAGE: Equal.Battery:I‚Äôve never had an issue with my Bose‚Äôs battery. The manufacturer claims 13 hours of playtime. Tribit claims to provide 24 hours of play time and has a port for charging your cell phone.ADVANTAGE: Equal.Durability:One thing you have to hand to Bose, their products are built to last. Despite the fact I cannot attest to the Tridbit's durability - Bose gets the vote.Advantage: BoseSummary:The Tribit Stormbox Pro is an amazing portable speaker at under $100. It meets or beats the Bose SoundLink Revolve in all categories. I don‚Äôt know how it would match up against the Bose SoundLink Revolve+ with runs $329.","Reviewed in the United States October 24, 2021",AG6WESEHODYUI74XLBFEQWAEAEKQ,True,61,color: blue

We rarely leave reviews unless our purchase was something we found excellent with great value. We have purchased 4 portable speakers to connect to our Dell 7200 2-in-1 which is a tablet and laptop. The factory sound is weak, flat an horrible and is not worth seeing a movie online. We have tried both a sound bar and aux. speaker. Most provided a wireless bluetooth and a wired connection. The Tribit's bluetooth was easy, stable and remains connected without issue or having to re-connect like our other bluetooth speakers. The sound is awesome, clear and distortion free. Our music taste goes from blues, jazz, soft rock and classical. Our movies vary. But this speaker sounds better at reproducing sound with much higher volume that is clear and sharp with little to distortion. The sound with only one speaker fills the room like a surround sound speaker system. We decided to purchase a 2nd Speaker and it was suggested. Today, I am very happy when my purchase exceeds my expectations as the Tribit did. With a discount and coupon our cost was only $95 and this was the best money we ever spent on a laptop speaker!!! My wife and I recommend this speaker and our seller who shipped this right away because our last speaker crapped out.

I literally have owned these speakers, ranked from 1 to , 1 being the best speaker I have ever owned in the portable Bluetooth speaker category. Keep in mind, I'm just the average everyday, in my car with 2 12 in subs by JL audio, Bose highs and lows (Armada SUV), and home entertainment center that is a old late 80s Marantz Amplifier attached to 2 Marantz floor 15s with highs and mids within the speakers. So, I'm no audiophile, no schooling to know notes and ranges or frequencies, just know when it is at 100 volume, is it distorted, does the bass give out at every hit if battery is half dead (Sony Bluetooth Speakers), and a few other important things I must have in a speaker such as; distance before the karate chopping the song to death starts, can it charge my phone as well (at a speed of 1.5a or higher if that even has hit a speaker yet), MAH capacity has to be 3000 or higher, portability is important, weather resistant is minor, I'm 45 and no longer desire to be with homies regardless of weather conditions or at a beach I'm black so I'm straight, I'll keep my ass indoors if it rains and pool parties was 20 years ago ipwhatever is only for my phone. Speaker who gives two turds, as long as it hits those marks I'm hella happy. Here we are and where this bad boy/girl ranks in my list of yompers.My list of amazing speaks/yompers1. Soundcore Select Pro: absolutely hands down best of it's class by a Seattle Slew distance. Price is unbeatable at 55 dollars during December, regular 90 dollars. Reason you don't see it on Amazon, cause soundcore realized they sold it at a way to cheap price and rebranded it with the motion boom, motion boom is second but the select Pro is by far all around number 1 which includes any JBL Bose Sony or pick one, soundcore nailed it.2. Motion boom soundcore: same as select Pro but more money and bigger battery. Oh they charge devices at the Anker iq speed, since soundcore is Anker, makes since.3. Oontz: damn brilliant design, first to do it triangular and the price point is beyond mi dblowing. My first was the smallest one, I ran down stairs demanded my wife stop her job and hear this little walkey sized speaker, not bunch of bass but clarity and loudness unmatched, 20 dollars and 69 for the biggest one and get 2 of the biggest one they make and they just passed soundcore due to stereo sound and only 120 and you have a speaker, really 2 that sound studiesqe.4. This speaker. Almost a tie with oontz big boy but the price of this one has me putting it 4. Had it been more like 49, number 1.5, soundcore is top dawg for awhile just cause of the app and everything involved. This speaker though is super attractive, chicks come up to just want to hold it, sometimes I gotta ask what it is that they want to hold cause I forget I have in hand cause it's not charge (JBL) heavy or awkward like the many out there. It sounds on par with the megaboom 2 from ue. Not as much bass but the 360 and the clarity is beautiful and filling if starving to hear a rap song like some pac that you just need to hear the message, the best is nice but days the message is what matters and this speaker is that speaker.I could go on on and on, frankly that's to much texting and if my lady knew I wrote this much I be hung immediately and divorced while hanging. So I gotta go but I hope my grammar and structure wasn't to over the place but I'm trying to write and ensure snoop wifey wife don't snoop over my shoulder and say, "" oh ok I see, so when I get a bae I'm drivn and I know you parked at the store cause I followed you, but you can opinionize on a yomper, boi you foul"" so yeah.

R6U4AEBND1YAC,B08MZZTH1N,4.0 out of 5 stars *positive update* older version of storm box speaker doesnt pair with the upgraded model,daniel,4,"7/26/23 update:mona from tribit customer service reached out and kindly arranged for an authentic older version of this speaker to be shipped to me direct from their warehouse and so far, the stereo pairing works great and the speakers sound amazing.sound quality is 6 stars out of 5, build quality is also 5/5 stars. battery life is a solid 4/5-these bad boys put out 40 watts each and last at least 8-9 hours. the one snag is bluetooth connectivity; id give these a 3.5/5 unfortunately. i feel the sound quality makes up for it completely but it is annoying when the right or left channel disconnects or goes out of synch with the other speaker when standing in between the speakers or turning the volume up or down. this is a general issue i've experienced with all kinds of tribit bluetooth speakers i have around my house so, if having to turn your speakers on and off in the middle of listening session is a deal breaker you may have to step up to a higher tier of brand.i have them set up in my large family room for music and podcasts and the smaller tribit stormbox go's on my desk connected to my macbook and ipad and i'm very happy with these speakers and this brand. the sound fills the room and the subwoofers are a nice addition.original review:after a year of using this speaker, taking it back and forth to europe and los angeles, using it at the beach, in the bathroom, as a speaker for a TV, laptop, etc, i bought a second 'upgraded' one since i'm so satisfied with the product. i cant wait to pair them together and see how the stereo sounds. it's loud but the bass can be too much sometimes so, play with the volume on your device and speaker to find the right balance you personally prefer. my one friend with the a bose competition speaker without returned her $220 speaker for this one and she's happy with it.UPDATE:down from 5 stars to 3. the 'upgraded' version of the stormbox pro does not pair with the older model i bought ONLY A YEAR AGO. the brand doesn't mention this in its listing; you have to search ""stereo pairing"" in the 'answered questions' section on the amazon page of the upgraded version and the older version doesn't even exist anymore on their official website. very disappointing and shady.the upgraded speaker also sounds slightly muddier and muffled compared to the older version; that can be the space I have the speaker in or the music i listen to but, having both speakers next to me and switching the same devo song between the two, there was a noticeable difference.is this upgraded version still a very good bluetooth speaker worth the price in comparison with its competition? yes.is it loud and really high quality? absolutelyam i still satisfied with the older version i purchased a year ago? definitely. I'm riding that thing til the wheels fall off lol.did i return it? yes. i need two stereo speakers for my personal desk and I do not want nor need to purchase two brand-new, overpowered, 40w bluetooth speakers.","Reviewed in the United States July 7, 2023",AGWZOATXLMNI7NWVJ76LZ3FF5VKQ,True,6,color: blue

RL1GIAX00LDVB,B08MZZTH1N,5.0 out of 5 stars Needs some adjustments for best sounds,xiao zhang,5,"First of all, this speaker looks and feels premium. I'm gonna go straight to sound quality part. Right out of box, the sound can turn off most people, including me. I almost put the speaker back in the box and returned it. The xbass feature makes very little difference in bass output. Let me put it this way. This speaker is for people who like flat and clean sound. However, after I downloaded the app, the equalizer makes huge improvements. When making adjustments on equalizer, the midrange and highs can be notably different by just tweaking 1 to 2 dbs. Nevertheless, for the bass, you have to tweak 5 to 6 DBS to hear the difference. The bass does not get booming. It's always clean and musical. This speaker is not for bassheads. The bass sounded muddy and almost distorted at the beginning. However, after few days of listening, the bass improved a lot. It got punchier and almost no distortion even at high volume. The overall sound is now balanced and transparent. I compared it to my bose SoundLink. To me, this speaker made bose sounded like there is a curtain in front of it. In conclusion. I am very happy with this purchase.

(and why do people keep spelling it ‚Äúbase‚Äù?)My only gripe with this speaker (and just about any good Bluetooth speaker) is the uneven response when turned up. Reviewers blather on and on about how great the bass is without any consideration for even, clean, sound reproduction. I am a rock musician so I like loud bass but I also like to hear the mids and highs as well. Given the size of these speakers there is just so much bass that can be cranked through them and still sound good. The good thing about 60 watts of power is that - even though I can only put the speaker at about 70-80 percent before the bass starts overwhelming the mids and highs - it is still pretty loud for my needs.This is a good speaker but, like most speakers, it just tries too hard to be bass heavy and not smooth and even.Original review:I really like the way this speaker sounds at low to middle volume. At that level the bass has an impressive level and it‚Äôs tight sounding. I would have given this speaker a full five stars if the EQ in the app was useful. There aren‚Äôt enough bands of adjustment on the EQ and it doesn‚Äôt hold the settings. The EQ is also not designed to show you exactly what sound profile is active at any time. Like I mentioned, turned up to about 40-50% the sound is very good. This sucker gets loud. Once one goes over 50% volume the upper mids to the high end start to get very harsh. I find that higher than 50% that killing the bass boost helps a lot. The speakers sound evens out quite a bit when you take off the bass boost at higher volumes. 60 watts of output power doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean ‚Äúlouder‚Äù than a 40 watt amp, there is just more headroom. I never push any sound device past 80-ish percent because going past that on any speaker/amp or on any sound system is just asking for trouble and disappointment. At 80% the sound is acceptable with the bass boost off. Remember the size of this thing. It‚Äôs definitely not a hip-hop thumper bumper. Killing the bass boost actually does make really loud volume sound better. Before I gave up on the EQ in the app I was able to even out the response at higher volume nicely it‚Äôs a custom profile. The inability to know what preset was active, and the tendency of the EQ to not even change from one sound profile to another was also annoying. I don‚Äôt need to connect 100 speakers or have a rave in my backyard or ever use this on a sandy beach so this speaker works very well sitting on the counter in my bathroom. Overall a very good purchase at the price for my use.","Reviewed in the United States May 16, 2023",AFZFPPHFXVVWBFJ36DY45MKHWAGQ,True,14,color: blue

Comparing to their competing brands holy cow this is worth every single penny, I think you can notice how much I love this speaker at this point üòÇ because I really do especially like a music fanatic like me you want to hear even the littlest of details and this speaker treats that like waking up and drinking cold water in the middle of the night.

I paired them both and heck yeah !!!! Beautiful sound and clarity ! Beautiful bass ! They have a nice hefty weight to them and they are sturdy and well built. The extra bass boost button absolutely pumps up that bass ! I love the the carrying handle too. Very strong thick rubber. I placed them on the floor by the wall on either end of the living room and the sound was astounding. I definitely felt the surround sound engulf me as these claim to be Hi Fidelity 360‚Äôs. I strongly suggest you place them near walls to get the very best sound. I was deeply impressed and quite satisfied with their performance at less than half the volume !

RBN385A46UFYY,B08MZZTH1N,3.0 out of 5 stars OK for the price range its in but definitely not a B&O.,jtfreelancer,3,"I purchased this speaker along with the Bang and Olufsen Beosound A1 2nd Gen. I was looking for a decently portable water resistant speaker for use around the house and while on vacation. I rolled the dice on the Tribit StormBox Pro because the smaller StormBox Micro has a great review on WhatTheHifi. My criteria were USB C, long battery life 15+ hours, IP67, bluetooth 5 or greater, and AAC support for Apple Hifi.The StormBox Pro sounds like every other midlevel bluetooth speaker (i.e. JBL Flip 5, Sony XB23). It is definitely loud but the sound lacks refinement. It outputs the same sound level at approximately 40% volume as the Beosound outputs at 70%. However, the audio sounds like it is coming out of a can. The enclosure definitely influences the sound. With the B&O you just hear the music and it sounds spacious. The soundstage separates the individual instruments. With the StormBox everything sounds on top of one another. Fine details get lost. If you are wanting to listen to Top 40 super loud at the pool or the beach then the StormBox will be fine. It will have better battery life and you don't have to worry about your $200 speaker walking off or breaking. Plus you can buy two StormBoxes for the price of the B&O.When it comes to deciding between the Tribit and a JBL or Sony it will come down to battery life, size, weight, and if you prefer having an app to change settings like Sony has. I think the sound on all three will be close enough. Flossy Carter has a great review of the SoundBox Pro vs the Flip 5 on YouTube. He also reviews the Beosound.One last note concerning Bluetooth performance. I was looking forward to a range increase from 4.2 devices to 5.0+ devices. I tested the range of an older 4.2 speaker against the StormBox Pro 5.2 and Beosound 5.1. All three speakers started to break up around the same area of my house within a few feet so 5.0+ isn't life changing. Perhaps the transmission quality and battery efficiency are better but I have no way to test that. As a side note, my Airpods 3 performed the best range wise going about 10 feet further than all three bluetooth speakers.","Reviewed in the United States January 26, 2022",AHYUWEK7XUDF3MFRJTFYA6G4I3AQ,True,5,color: blue

RDYDQVKW1BRIH,B08MZZTH1N,5.0 out of 5 stars Great for TV satellite speaker setup,mike,5,"Looking for an easy solution to add a satellite speaker to my older Vizio sound bar so that the living room TV could be heard easily in the kitchen, I purchased an Avantree Bluetooth transmitter receiver. The idea was to use the optical passthrough function on the Avantree unit and broadcast the TV sound signal to a portable Bluetooth speaker. Unfortunately, most Bluetooth speakers (including Bose) use low quality Bluetooth codecs, which result in enough delay that there was an annoying echo when the Bluetooth speaker and TV speakers were both on. This speaker uses the aptx codec, which has a low latency mode with nearly no delay. I can now have the tv volume at a reasonable low level, and have the Stormbox in the kitchen while cooking or cleaning up, each with independently adjustable volumes. As the Avantree can connect to two devices, I'll probably buy another unit to hack together a whole house sound system for about $300 total.Alone on a flat surface, the speaker sounds okay, but thin. Because of the way sound works, no matter the claims of any speaker brand, speaker cones need to move a lot of air to sound good. No small speaker will ever sound as good as a large multi speaker cabinet. Because I'm pairing this to a sound bar with a woofer, the tinny sound is supplemented by the woofer just fine, and spoken lines from movies and vocals from music actually stand out a little more, which is a good thing in my situation.The Stormbox isn't as pretty as the Bose equivalent, but its laughably better in every other way, for less than half the price.","Reviewed in the United States January 29, 2022",AHJPDCYC74TKCKO6EEHGLLWYIM7Q,True,0,color: blue

Barnes,3,"I kept looking for a reason to keep this speaker but I simply couldn't come up with one. I bought the original Stormbox 4 years ago and it blew me away with the vibrancy and dimensionality I heard, all of it complimented with a bass that punched above its weight. So here it is 2022 and I figured I'd check out the Pro. I expected more of the same, only bigger. That's not happened. Immediately you'll see that the outside of the Pro has more of a clothy feel to it all over.And that's exactly what wrong with speaker.Everything I loved about the original Stormbox is gone in the Pro. The vibrancy is gone, the dimensionality and separation is gone and the music sounds like its trying to come through fabric, robbing the music of its highs and mids. The app was finicky and not intuitive at all. It was hard to work the EQ and I could hardly hear any impact. I was hearing performance in the original; in the Pro, it seems like I was just hearing music coming out of a radio.What you do get with the Pro, however, is much more big, honkin' bass. And, yes, it does get mighty loud. And the bass, even at this size, still punches above weight.Now that's not to say the sound had too much bass but it could've stood to be a bit tighter (but at this price point that's wishful thinking). The amount of bass was fine but I really wanted the mids and highs and dimensionality to come out and join the party as well as they did so much better in the original.This will be a return.","Reviewed in the United States December 9, 2022",AFDFKRHUG3WVWHCKUTDDB5KFEOAQ,True,8,color: blue

In a workout room or larger open areas it sounds much better.So I have a 2nd generation Amazon echo. We use it to listen to music while working out at our house. The sound from the echo has always been surprisingly good, with solid bass for such a small speaker. I think the echo has a 2.5 inch woofer and a smaller tweeter in it. I was hoping to upgrade from it since we got it in 2017. This speaker honestly isn‚Äôt really close to that echo bass wise. Clarity wise, the Stormbox sounds good. I‚Äôve listened to it for a day so far and I‚Äôm disappointed. Maybe my expectations were a little too high, but a speaker from 2017 shouldn‚Äôt sound just as good or slightly better than this speaker I feel like.

I also note that when I‚Äôm ‚Äústereo mode‚Äù the Bluetooth range is limited to about 10 feet (between the two speakers) but in ‚ÄúParty mode‚Äù I get a range of 30 to 40 feet before I get Bluetooth drop off.2. Switching between the two devices can be cumbersome (I found the best way is to go into the Bluetooth setting in the active device and ‚Äúdisconnect‚Äù before switch to the second device).3. Notification (sounds) and answering my iPhone doesn‚Äôt always work (but I don‚Äôt like answering my phone over the speaker [privacy issues] so for me, this is not a big issue).Edit: After talking w/ Apple Support I discovered that the Bluetooth dropping (when switching between app while listening to music [while connected to my TriBit StormBox Pro]) is an Apple issue w/ their current software (iOS 14.7). But that doesn‚Äôt explain the Bluetooth distance issue when in stereo mode vs party mode.","Reviewed in the United States June 17, 2021",AGJGW3TLTKAA3H3PKELQM4ELLO6A,True,4,color: blue

It could be a couple of dollars more, or maybe a couple dollars less. I am not familiar with every speaker in this price range but for the few I have experience with, there's no comparison. These include the JBL Flip, The Bose Soundlink, The Sony SRS, The UE Boom and others. The problem is that it's an unfair comparison. These speakers are much smaller than the Stormbox Pro and they all perform much smaller as well. To get a fairer comparison, you need the JBl Charge or the UE Mega Boom and the Bose Soundlink Revolve but then, you're in an entirely different price range and I believe this speaker can punch with those guys as well! It may not win the fight but it wouldn't be a KO! Add in the fact that you can buy two of these and connect them together for the price of the the Soundlink Revolve and it's clear. The Strombox is clearly King Of The Mountain right now.","Reviewed in the United States August 31, 2022",AGSQH6BTSMB3IZYQSRD3JOBH2X2Q,True,3,color: blue

It has 360 sound but two sides have 2 speakers and 2 have 1 so if you rotate it it hits different but its not that noticble if youre not within a couple feet of it.

Did my research and ended up going with Tribit over the Sonos roam since I already have a Sonos soundbar for TV and love it. Very happy with decision. Great value, very well built and delivers nice clear sound. My cons are comes with very short non braided cable and should STOP using plastic caps for packaging (should be cardboard). Yes, it does take 7-8 hours to charge but hey you get a long life battery so for a speaker where I do not need a quick charge I have little issue with this. I like the larger capacity battery. Overall for a decent bluetooth portable speaker in the $100-200 range this has my vote. Was not familiar with Tribit brand, own Sonos, Bose and JBL. Holds its own and well built.

For instance, if the volume is on a scale of 1-10 with 1 being the lowest audible volume, the volume jumps from a 2 to a 5 with just 1 increase of your phone's volume adjustment. This happens with any phone or app and with both speakers. I emailed Tribit support and they said these are high volume speakers so the overall volume is loud. That doesn't make sense as my car and home audio are significantly louder but have the ability to fine tune lower volume levels.Why is this an issue? We camp and travel a lot and play music by the fire after the kid's go to sleep, and the low volume is barely audible, but then increase it 1 notch and the volume is too loud for quiet hours, there needs to be more steps of adjustment in-between. I think this could be easily fixed with a firmware update. Until that happens, I cannot recommend these as an everyday all around speaker, but rather they're more niche for when you want high volume, in which case these excel at that.","Reviewed in the United States July 18, 2022",AFX56PFKD6PZOSUXWTRQV3H3CFOA,True,3,color: blue

The Pro was no doubt a nicer looking much louder speaker with audio output that was clear at high and low volume. The battery life is nothing short of outstanding. However, because I've owned the former Stormbox speaker/s for a couple years, I find that the bass reproduction even with bass boost activated on the Pro, low and high volume in my humble opinion was subpar in comparison.

R3FXXMYB4LCBKF,B07DD3VXRZ,1.0 out of 5 stars The worst speaker every when used as two or more together,Charles Magnuson,1,"The media could not be loaded. I have two opinions of the Ultimate Ears Boom speakers.When used as a single speaker, the Ultimate Ears Boom 3 speaker works well. The sound quality and loudness are good for a speaker of its size. The Bluetooth range is rather pathetic as I lose connection after moving about 20 feet away from the speaker's audio source, but I blame Bluetooth for being a lousy wireless standard more than the speaker for that fault. The speaker can be used every day in the shower with no negative repercussions. Overall, the Boom 3 speaker is a great speaker when used by itself.The situation completely changes when attempting to use two or more Boom speakers together. I'll go into details below, but I can confidently say that I've experienced few pieces of technology that are more unreliable and frustrating than the Boom 3 speakers when trying to get them paired together and playing the same audio.First, the Ultimate Ears Boom app is a huge frustration. Getting even a single speaker to show up in the app can require multiple disconnects, app force quits, and speaker restarts. Once a primary speaker shows up in the UE Boom app, getting other speakers to show up is near impossible. Each and every day I want to use the speakers together, I have to go through a 20-minute process of forgetting Bluetooth settings, repairing, and powering off and on speakers. It is such a frustrating process that I usually rage quit and forgo using the speakers together.Then, once the speakers are connected together they regularly start clicking and thumping as they stutter during audio playback. Even when I move the two speakers within a foot of each other and the audio source, they regularly and constantly stutter and lose bits of audio. Listening to an entire song without missing parts is impossible when using the Ultimate Ears Boom speakers together in Party Up or Two-Up mode.Simply put, THESE SPEAKERS DO NOT WORK WHEN PAIRED TOGETHER. The Boom speakers are completely worthless when used together as the audio they play is unlistenable.I really enjoyed the single Ultimate Ears Boom speaker I used on its own for about two years, but after experiencing the disaster which is Party Up mode and the Ultimate Ears Boom app, I will never again purchase another Ultimate Ears product. This experience has just been too frustrating and I've wasted $300 on two speakers I cannot use together.","Reviewed in the United States November 2, 2018",AFN57XUWIRHZ24FA7IVOW5HXLL2Q,True,284,Color: Sunset RedPattern: Speaker
R3E39REOEKMJHO,B07DD3VXRZ,2.0 out of 5 stars DO NOT BUY: Ruined my relationship with ULTIMATE EARS :(,Hailey DeArruda,2,"üíóLet me start by saying before buying this product I have been a HUGE, longtime fan of the Ultimate Ears brand.I purchased the original Wonderboom portable bluetooth speaker maybe 5 years ago or longer? I originally purchased it because I wanted something waterproof that I could use in the shower. It was GREAT for that purpose, and also proved to be an awesome all-around portable bluetooth speaker. Sound quality was great for the price range and size. Volume was SUPER as well. I loved the big loop on the back that you could hang on all sorts of things. I LOVE the concept of the Magic Button in the center to Play, Pause & Skip. The Skip Feature is ESPECIALLY hard to find on a speaker in this price range and I love it for use at work when I may not be able to easily access my phone. Bluetooth connection was great. Battery life originally lasted anywhere between 4-6hrs at least which was great. THIS SPEAKER LASTED ME AT LEAST 5 YEARS with little to no change in quality. I LOVED THIS SPEAKER! Unfortunately, I left it at work one week when I was on vacation and just left it there figuring my coworkers could use it and would respect it enough. Long story short, I came back and it wasn't working as well or holding a charge properly. It was a sad end to a good story.üîçFinally, I find myself in need of a new speaker. Because I LOVED my original WONDERBOOM so much, I decided to search within the Ultimate Ears line.((It also just so happens at my current job our department owns two WONDERBOOM2 speakers! I've noticed their battery life doesn't work as well, but they still worked pretty decent.))So I wanted one of the newest, nicest speakers in the Ultimate Family. The Hyperboom was too large to transport from home and work, and cost way more than I was looking to spend, so that was out of the question. So immediately I decided to research between the BOOM3 & the MEGABOOM3. In conclusion, through reviews I read I concluded that most consumers felt the bass was overpowering for the Megaboom3 with no real volume increase, and simply diminished the quality of the sound. SO, I DECIDED TO PURCHASE THE BOOM3!1Ô∏è‚É£üÜïFirst impression out of the box, it looked nice enough. I preferred the more compact design of the Wonderboom, and DEFINITELY missed the larger, more practical loop. It still has the magic button which is a HUGE selling point to me and very accommodating.I charged it up to 100% and decided to unplug it and test it out for a while at home. It worked well, sounded almost exactly like the Wonderboom as far as sound QUALITY. I might be wrong but as far as VOLUME goes I feel it may have had the same volume limitations as the original Wonderboom, if anything maybe SLIGHTLY louder. However, I was happy it seemed to be fully functioning and worked just as well as my other one.I also liked that in addition to that, I was able to use the Ultimate Ears app in conjunction with the product to REMOTE START the speaker from my phone. Again, this is another HUGE selling point to me because I mainly use this product at work. It also has an EQUALIZER function which is definitely cool, although I don't feel like it's very accurate. It also has some sort of feature where you can set certain clicks on the Magic Button to play certain playlists automatically, which sounds cool although I never got to personally try it.All in all, it seemed like a good replacement at first.‚ö†Ô∏èü™´THE NEXT DAY COMES & HERE IS WHERE THE PROBLEMS BEGIN. I come into work with my charger FULLY charged at 100%. I use Remote-Start on the app to turn on the speaker. The Remote-Start feature also displays the approximate battery percentage (by 10% increments) of the speaker. At this point, my speaker was at 100% charge.I used the speaker for between 1.5hrs<2hrs before it gave me the Low Battery warning for 10%. So, I put it on the charger and continued to let it play. It lasted maybe another 20minutes, before it died.Now this is VERY disappointing considering my ORIGINAL WONDERBOOM that came out 5+ years ago would last for 4-6hrs on FULL VOLUME without being on a charger. Not only that, but the ORIGINAL WONDERBOOM would ALSO last for a WHILE on the charger even when battery wasn't full.This was disappointing, but didn't seem like a crisis, just a bit sad.The next day, is when the BIGGER issue began. I admittedly forgot to charge my BOOM3 when I got home the night before, and then brought it to work. When I wake up, I charge it until I leave for 1.5HOURS!When I arrive at work, I charge it for an additional 1HOUR before, checking the battery percentage on the app which reads 60%. So, I decide to turn it on and use it while STILL LEAVING IT ON THE CHARGER. NOT EVEN 30 MINUTES GO BY UNTIL THE SPEAKER DIES!!!!!!!!! So, irritated I turn it off, opt for my AirPods and leave the speaker to charge for a few hours. I let this SPEAKER CHARGE FOR 4 MORE HOURS BEFORE USING IT. Finally, I check the battery on the app which only says 40%????? So I turn on the speaker and leave it plugged in, IT LASTS FOR LESS THAN ONE SONG BEFORE DYING!LET ME TELL YOU, THIS SPEAKER BROUGHT OUT PURE RAGE IN ME AT WORK. ü™´‚ö†Ô∏èüò°I feel so pissed, and cheated and ripped off. I was such a big fan and advocate for the Ultimate Ears brand, but how are you gonna sell me a NEWER, MORE EXPENSIVE speaker and MAKE IT SIGNIFICANTLY worse. Considering this is the BOOM3, I WOULD HOPE & ASSUME IT IS GOING TO BE BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL WONDEBOOM FROM 5 YEARS AGO, BUT I GUESS NOT. Thanks, Logitech, just charge me more money for a FAR INFERIOR PRODUCT, with the illusion that is going to be somewhat improved. However; this speaker is simply, for my needs- UNUSABLE & FRUSTRATING!!! HUUUUUGE DOWNGRADE üëéüò¢Very, very disappointed in the Ultimate Ears brand for putting out this one. Like I sad it really is a shame because I was a HUGE supporter of their brand and unfortunately this product was so disappointing and frustrating that it has ruined my relationship with this company for good.I loved the convenience of the Magic Button with the Skip Feature, the portability, durability, great waterproof technology, super big, useful loop, the sound quality & volume, and the battery life of ORIGINAL WONDERBOOM, but this product has ruined all that unfortunately.‚ö†Ô∏èDO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND SAVE YOUR MOMEY üí∏ BECAUSEYOU WILL NEED TO RETURN IT & REPLACE IT WITH ANOTHER SPEAKER!!!!!!! THIS SPEAKER IS NOT FUNCTIONAL! ‚ö†Ô∏èSorry, Ultimate Ears, but do better.","Reviewed in the United States November 17, 2022",AFSWDPDFGUZCY4TIBMKU2QD3275A,True,148,Color: Night BlackPattern: Speaker

Sin embargo, he de decir que el BOOM 3 me sorprendi√≥ sobremanera: agudos y medios en su punto y los bajos, aunque poco notorios y exagerados, son c√≥modos y audibles.2. VOLUMEN Y POTENCIAEl BOOM 3 es ideal para aquellos que quieran utilizarlo en una habitaci√≥n peque√±a o en una reuni√≥n o fiesta. Esto es as√≠ porque puede llegar a ser discreto y a la vez muy potente sin llegar a afectar demasiado la calidad de sonido.3. WATERPROOFNo he testeado el parlante sumergi√©ndolo de lleno en agua, pero se ha llegado a mojar levemente y hasta el momento no ha presentado problemas.Lleg√≥ la hora de hablar de lo malo:1. CARGA Y BATER√çASi bien es cierto que la duraci√≥n de la bater√≠a no es el fuerte de este aparato, uno esperar√≠a m√°s por algo que cuesta m√°s de cien d√≥lares. Hay aparatos much√≠simo m√°s econ√≥micos que tienen una carga m√°s duradera independientemente del uso. Si usas el BOOM 3 discretamente, la bater√≠a puede durar m√°s de 10 horas non-stop. Pero si usas el BOOM 3 con el volumen m√°ximo, la carga solo te va a durar cuatro o cinco horas (a menos que lo uses mientras est√© conectado a la energ√≠a). Se entiende que se hayan decantado por un uso m√°s discreto y se hayan enfocado en un parlante que provea una calidad de sonido √≥ptima, pero repito: este parlante cuesta m√°s de cien d√≥lares y me parece que la bater√≠a qued√≥ a deber.2. BUGS Y FUNCIONALIDADES IN√öTILESEl bot√≥n Magic est√° muy bien pero tiene muchos defectos. Por ejemplo, no reconoce si laa playlists que a√±adas est√°n en aleatorio y las termina reproduciendo por default. El conectar dos parlantes con la app me parece genial pero dudo mucho que alguien lo vaya a usar del todo. Con la app de Ultimate Ears no siempre puedes conectarte al aparato y en esos casos debes encenderlo manualmente. Hubo una vez que el aparato no respond√≠a a la conexi√≥n y, debido a que la caja no incluye un manual de instrucciones, tuve que buscar en internet para ver c√≥mo lo reseteaba por defecto.Resumiendo:Buena calidad de sonido, buena potencia y buena resistencia al agua. Mala distribuci√≥n de la carga y mal sistema de conexi√≥n.¬øVale la pena comprarlo? Depende de c√≥mo lo quieras usar. Si pretendes usar un parlante para un uso m√°s dom√©stico y disfrutar de la m√∫sica en una calidad de sonido decente, este es tu producto. Pero si quieres algo m√°s profesional o externo, puedes conseguir algo mejor.","Reviewed in the United States June 24, 2023",AE55TVZYQ4SFDSGABXMU7JPEDKFA,True,14,Color: Night BlackPattern: Speaker

R10AD2QSAZA36K,B07DD3VXRZ,4.0 out of 5 stars Preferred this over Bose and JBL speakers,Tyler Cash,4,"I went to a Best Buy to look at portable bluetooth speakers. I was able to compare bluetooth speakers from Bose, JBL, and Ultimate Ears. Of all the speakers I listened to at this size and price point, this had the best sound. Best Buy didn't have any BOOM 3 speakers in stock, so I ordered from Amazon. Its been a definite upgrade from my previous similarly sized portable bluetooth speaker, with stronger bass hits and bigger sound overall. The bigger (and more expensive) speakers I listened to sounded better for sure, but the BOOM 3 does great for a more affordable speaker of its size.Its no audiophile speaker. It's tuned for popular music, with particular emphasis on bass and percussive hits. Which is fine, since that's what I was looking for and expecting from a speaker of this size and price. It does a decent job with today's top-40 style music. I don't listen to much rap or R&B, but I think it would do great with those genres as well. Music like Olivia Rodriguez's ""Good 4 U"" was pretty satisfying to listen to. Ultimate ears even provides an app where you can EQ the sound to something that you personally like even better.Music like ""Tightrope"" from the Greatest Showman soundtrack or ""Zanarkand"" from Final Fantasy Distant Worlds was a different story. They sounded muddy and lacked detail in a very unsatisfying way. I don't thing the EQ app can do anything to help that out. You'll want a different speaker if you're looking for a speaker for vocal, orchestral, jazz, etc.","Reviewed in the United States November 27, 2022",AFHDPQ3WBQQMUQNB46TWQCOSHXPQ,True,21,Color: Night BlackPattern: Speaker

One was perfect the other didn‚Äôt charge. Such easy replacement from Amazon, got it the next day. This one is perfect. You can pair them together to get stereo sound. The sound is phenomenal, pairing is so simple. One of the best speakers out there. I have chosen it over Bose everyday, and I am a Bose girl.If you want immense sound and need it to be easy get any of the wonderboom products.The app is new to me and I need to work with it but I use my Amazon music on it and just party like it‚Äôs 1999 in my bathroom getting ready for work.Get the warranty, which I didn‚Äôt but should have because when it decides to not charge you will be sad and anxious for a new one. I have had my 1st one for 5 years, I dropped it, regularly and no problems. I use it in the bathroom next to the sink because it is waterproof.The charging dock I haven‚Äôt seen it really charge yet, but I could be doing it wrong. But the cord is easy peasy.I love my boom 3 and will stick with Ultimate ears for years to come. You can pair I think up to 20 with the boom 3.

The inconsistent quality is frustrating and I will be looking for a different speaker now.I originally bought one in 2020 and it lasted me 3 years of almost daily use until it started cutting in and out. It would play music and then briefly cut out and back in (like a hiccup) every few minutes. I found it pretty annoying so I ordered a new one. This one was even worse as it started cutting in and out like the last one, but after only 3 weeks of use. I initiated a return, and hopefully I can get it because I threw the box away after I opened it. After 2 of the same speaker, I would say I don't really recommend this one because while my first one did last me 3 years and was great, it seems that the quality of them is inconsistent, so I will be looking for a different one soon.","Reviewed in the United States February 1, 2024",AE2V2FGKUSXIKL3U3IWWW4L42IKA,True,3,Color: Lagoon BluePattern: Speaker

R200IE3MUNI9EU,B07DD3VXRZ,5.0 out of 5 stars good size + sound quality,Omar Siddique,5,"Nice clear mids & decent bass, in an attractive device, make this an all-around winner.On the negative side: there's a mostly unnecessary app, oversized volume buttons, and a I'd prefer it had a USB-C power connector instead of the old ""micro"" connector.Over all, this is a great speaker. It also looks really nice, and feels solid in-hand. The UE is small/light enough that I use it as my travel speaker, although I prefer the boom-ier bass on my (heavier) JBL for workout and party music at home.This speaker sounds good, but not obtrusive-- natural for various genres. The default tuning is ""fine"". Unusual for a Bluetooth speaker, there is an EQ feature on the app, but it doesn't let you turn one band up without decreasing the others. Good for tuning the sound quality for eg, spoken podcasts, but you can't turn up the bass or the treble like you might on a usual sound system.The app also allows using the speaker's top ""smart"" button to automatically launch playlists without otherwise interacting with a device. A clever idea, but since I usually use an AI (like Google Assistant) I find it unnnecessary, and better to not have too many random apps installed. The speaker works beautifully without the app-- totally optional.I used to buy Logitech PC speakers long ago, and they still make good ""gaming"" speakers. It's interesting Logi acquired Ultimate Ears, a brand I hadn't heard of before. A good move on their part, as this is one of the two best speakers I tested recently in my search for the perfect hardware.Highly Recommended.","Reviewed in the United States September 3, 2020",AGMITI35DNIHMTUWA6JSEYH43FGQ,True,9,Color: Sunset RedPattern: Speaker

R1KELUR90PO5A3,B07DD3VXRZ,5.0 out of 5 stars Great little speaker,Labcoated,5,"I've been putting this speaker through its paces for the last few hours and I'm really impressed. Sound quality, water resistance, and build quality is all there. The app is well designed, pairing is quick and easy, and bluetooth range covers my entire apartment.It's important to understand that you're not gonna get crazy sub bass on this thing, but that's not what they're trying to do here. One thing I really have to hand it to UE for on this speaker is instead of trying to reproduce frequencies in those bottom sub ranges, they have obviously set a hard shelf on the EQ that totally eliminates those frequencies from the mix rather than try to make the small speakers in this unit try for it anyway. A lot of other bluetooth speakers I've heard fail pretty hard at that and you end up with distortion and a lot of muddiness in the low range because of it. The tradeoff is that especially low end music (namely drum and bass, dubstep, 808 heavy hip hop and trap, etc) isn't going to exactly shine on this speaker.What does sound great, though, is just about everything else that doesn't rely on sub bass. Rock, jazz, metal, most hip hop, most electronic, funk, r&b, podcasts, etc all sound really clear and have great dynamics. This speaker is also capable of going extremely loud. I couldn't get it past around 70% volume in my apartment without it being excessive, yet the music sounded totally clear and free of distortion even when I cranked it.Also, I brought it in the shower to test and it got wet without issue and dried off quickly.I just got the speaker so time will tell how reliable it is, but count me as impressed. I'm looking forward to taking this on river floats next summer. Really happy that well made, waterproof electronics are readily available now. That was by far one of the biggest selling points to me after the sound quality.They should have used USB C, that's maybe my biggest gripe, I've never cared for micro USB.","Reviewed in the United States December 15, 2018",AGVINZPVX6XN7HFBN4XKCKCLOOCA,True,49,Color: Night BlackPattern: Speaker

The sound was good and so was the Bluetooth range and the battery life is really good. It has notification sounds that play really loud but you can turn them off so that's not a big deal until you can't turn them off, or the speaker.6 months in the ""magic"" button got stuck. It was always a little touchy but it worked and I never paid it any mind but once it got stuck, none of the other buttons worked anymore. The volume and power buttons no longer responded because the magic button was constantly being pressed. There is an app and I could turn the power off that way but minutes later the power was back on because the magic button was depressed. It took days for the battery to run down and at certain intervals it would announce that some feature was not available and to check the aps internet connection, really loudly. When the battery finally ran down it started screaming that the battery was low every 30 seconds. i had to stash it out in the garage.I contacted support and they got back to me saying the warranty doesn't cover the stuck magic button because it was damaged, the kicker is I never said the speaker was damaged, only that the button was stuck.Since it was no longer covered I found a tutorial on how to take it apart and found that the screws that hold the switch in place were so tight that the switch didn't have room to release. I loosened the screws and the speaker is back to working like it should except it's no longer waterproof. That sounds like a manufacturing defect to me. I let Logitech support know what I found and we'll see what they have to say.I would have given the speaker 5 stars but the business with support knocks it down a couple notches in my opinion.","Reviewed in the United States August 7, 2020",AHRLZLHRJOA3UFOB2ZV5EEI2EO2A,True,2,Color: Night BlackPattern: Speaker

RDTJ4OJICTP06,B07DD3VXRZ,"2.0 out of 5 stars Stopped charging after a month, good sound, bad bluetooth, awkward charge cord",Ammon,2,"The sound was good while it lasted. Issues that may concern potential buyers: 1. My Boom3 stopped charging after about a month. It doesn't come with a power adapter. Their instructions and FAQ say to charge using any USB power adapter. I charged it using a surge protector with built-in USB ports. The tiny white charging indicator light has stopped lighting up. The device can recognize that it's plugged into an outlet, but it won't charge. I can't use the speaker anymore, and when I try to turn it on the voice just says, ""Charging, please wait."" I've tried other plugs and cords, but no luck. I'm just outside the Amazon return window (sucks because I want a refund) so I'll have to check if the company will exchange or credit it under warranty. 2. Was hoping to use it with my PC, but audio keeps cutting out even though speaker is right next to the case. I tried the troubleshooting tips in their FAQ multiple times, followed other user threads and tips, but never got it working well. All other bluetooth products I have (including noise cancelling headphones and testing it with my spouse's JBL speaker) worked fine. I even unpaired and ""forgot"" everything, then reconnected only the the Boom3... still cutting out at regular intervals. This is a pre-built gaming PC and only a few years old, so I really don't think it's the PC's fault. I found numerous people online with similar issues. 3. The cord that comes with this for charging is disappointing. It is micro USB, which means it is awkward to insert. Why not use USB-C on a newer product like this? The cord is solid white, so it looks garish plugged into my black Boom 3. Also, the plug housing is a big square, but the Boom3 charge slot is inside an oval recess - it's very snug and awkward to plug in. Finally, the cord is a flat/ribbon style - it does not want to go where you want it to go.","Reviewed in the United States April 12, 2022",AF2JAXPNOHN4CQ523YQQWVNAZ5VA,True,2,Color: Night BlackPattern: Speaker

I own two identical speakers which were bought at separate times and have the issue with both.The problem is that the Bluetooth connection randomly cuts in & out, similar to a popping. Happening in different environments, with different transmitting devices and also in daisy chain connections which is so bad that I can not use multiple speakers together. The problem is not consistent, I have checked the firmware level in the Boom app and it shows it is up to date. My two speakers experience the issue at all distances from the phone which range from sitting on the device, next to the device and then any distance range until it's to far to maintain connection.The issue comes and goes and has been happening more lately which is driving my dissatisfaction and this review. I really wanted this to be a good purchase so have given multiple chances for them to work at an acceptable level.I do not recommend the Boom 3 to anyone unless you get a serious discount and do not expect consistent sound. I'll definitely try another brand when I get so fed up with these that I just donate them away.Side note, it seems like BT can be spiritic on other speakers too so perhaps it's worth it to just get a speaker that offers a hard connection to avoid the frustrating situations when you want consistent sound over portability.","Reviewed in the United States March 6, 2023",AHDQACXK3VYQ6HYHHKFU3PNQSJBQ,True,0,Color: Ultraviolet PurplePattern: Speaker

IMO, the UE Boom 3‚Äôs are not only a good value, they are superlative in sound from low to high ranges at easy and medium volume. Great for voice, too, e.g. podcasts. I have 2 paired and will likely buy another pair (stereo is nice) for another room.I recently tried the UE Megablast and they don‚Äôt hold a candle to to crispness and range of the Boom 3‚Äôs. They‚Äôre loud and have some nice control features but for sound, IMO the 3‚Äôs are the best by far, and uncannily the least expensive of over 10 other brands, up to $300. Unless you‚Äôre filling a large room with loud music I‚Äôd say the Boom is the best speaker in it‚Äôs portable class. Enjoy, and don‚Äôt worry about missing any sound - you‚Äôll pleasantly hear it all!","Reviewed in the United States December 28, 2019",AEKGEHD6XSWX34ICGNG3YY3TBUKA,True,12,Color: Sunset RedPattern: Speaker
R2SSSH04J4J264,B0D4SX9RC6,5.0 out of 5 stars Really nice portable speaker for the price. Solid buy!,Bruce C,5,"Needed a new portable speaker for the home setup and once I saw that Beats (read: Apple) came out with the new Beats Pill, I bit the bullet and purchased one.First things first, the unboxing experience and the design of the speaker is quintessentially Apple. Speaker has a nice heft to it and the design of the speaker is really nice, with the angled design, and the speakers facing you.If you are in the Apple Ecosystem, this speaker was made for you as it connects to your iPhone the minute you turn it on with a very satisfying screen animation. I'm told you can easily connect with an Android product too but I didn't have one in hand to test out how easy it was.The sound quality of this speaker is really great for its size, living up to the Beats name, filling the room with punchy bass and crystal clear sound. Rated IP67 meaning it is dust and water resistant, so you can feel confident taking it to your next beach party or when you are traveling. Battery life of this thing is stated at a whopping 24 hrs. I'll definitely be testing that claim, but if true, is completely mind blowing.But what sets this speaker apart, and one of the main reasons why I bought it, is that it also doubles as a speakerphone!!! I can connect this badboy to my laptop, and take crystal clear Teams calls with it all day at work. And when I'm done with my calls, since it is connected to my laptop via USB-C, I can listen to lossless music on Apple Music. Mind...blown!Run, don't walk, to buy this awesome speaker!!","Reviewed in the United States July 1, 2024",AFVM53KRAU5JC462ZZDBBKTESPGA,True,18,Color: Statement RedStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+

Quick easy connection to our phones, good sound quality, solid build and long battery life. We have since found ourselves grabbing it instead of our existing outdoor speakers for using on the back patio. One feature we did not think we would use but really like is the speaker phone function. It is really nice for conversations with family that multiple people want to be involved in. Better then iPhone speaker phone alone.","Reviewed in the United States September 5, 2024",AFPN35SDBWBDQAGNSNQJQPQH5C2Q,True,0,Color: Champagne GoldStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+

The sound quality is amazing with great bass and clear vocals. It's small, stylish, and easy to carry around, which is perfect for when I'm on the go.The battery lasts a long time, even with heavy use, and connecting it to my devices with Bluetooth is super easy. The design looks good and fits well with any room or setup.The only downside is that there isn't an app to control the speaker. It would be nice to have an app to adjust settings, check battery life, and manage connections. Even without this, the Beats Pill 2024 is a fantastic speaker that I highly recommend.","Reviewed in the United States July 11, 2024",AEUCX7EIPTMCFN4OJBZHL2OYSVKQ,True,8,Color: Champagne GoldStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+
R39X7USU3OX34C,B0D4SX9RC6,5.0 out of 5 stars Really good,Justin,5,"So I‚Äôm super picky about sound and have spent a decent amount of money over the years finding good speakers. I was currently using the B&O Bluetooth speaker which is really good and is a bit more money than this. Prior I had Bose and some of other brands. Compared to all of them this is an amazing speaker for the price point. Bass is great. Clarity is great. Build quality is great. You can even hook it up via usb c to get lossless music. I didnt notice much a difference that way. Also if your in the apple eco system it works like AirPods where you can switch between devices and also locate the speaker via find my. Note I have also tried both of the newest beats over ear headphones and hated them, so I was surprised that this was as good as it is.","Reviewed in the United States July 8, 2024",AFSZPNTTLYCLNP536L6VS6UMFTNQ,True,7,Color: Statement RedStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+
R2EVRTXO9M1YF7,B0D4SX9RC6,4.0 out of 5 stars Is it the JBL killer?,Tommy,4,"I bought this because it was on sale, and I always wanted a beats pill.I am a JBL user, and firmly stand by their quality and sound.Does this compete with Flip 6? Absolutely.Does it compete with Charge 4 or 5? Definitely not.Heres whySound: i purchased the Black Pill, right out of the box it is versatile in the sense it matches anything you have. I could‚Äôve went with Champagne as well and would‚Äôve also fit. I compared to flip 6 right away, it is Brighter, crisper and deeper bass at 50% volume and lower.However at above 50% the bass becomes muddy, it has this weird flutter sound to it. The Flip 6 Still Sounds great at 50% and lower just it sounds a little quieter and less vibrant compared to the Pill.The Charge 4 and 5 are bigger speakers and has bigger woofers.The pill is definitely very portable, great performance and most definitely great value for the money.Maybe later down the road i will purchase another for stereo sound bars for our TV.","Reviewed in the United States July 23, 2024",AHAMVBSECCNUJMQV6A3BO3A3HNMA,True,5,Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+

R3EOM3PFJ90D5Y,B0D4SX9RC6,"3.0 out of 5 stars Good design, but bass distortion",Daniel,3,"The new pill looks awesome, and built extremely well... The tone when pairing emits a very low end bass note that gets you excited for the performance expected from Beats... However, with this being said, the performance is only half of what I hoped... the programmed sound processing limits using an external eq as boosted bass significantly drops the volume at each note, which is sad because pill doesn't have an eq in its app at all.... the sound you get between 40 percent and lower is where this shines, mids are clear and neutral, highs are clear and crisp without any harshness, and there is a slight amount of low end at lower volume, but past halfway volume and the bass distorts and the programming takes over to then roll off the bass and then it's mostly just mids and highs.... They seriously could've added a passive radiator to the back of this thing and then would have something here.... All this, and the package arrived with the box already opened.... not too excited about my purchase....","Reviewed in the United States July 2, 2024",AHAIN2MT2BFGIAXCVJCMTI6NEDGA,True,5,Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+
RTDXQGCW5S0SA,B0D4SX9RC6,4.0 out of 5 stars Almost perfect,Scooley,4,"I bought the new pill mainly to use wired for my gaming handhelds ROG Ally X and Steam Deck. Most Bluetooth speakers today are lacking AUX ports and any type of direct connection. Bluetooth audio is delayed which is annoying when playing a game or watching a video.CON: Only 4 stars instead of 5 because to use this wired you need to hold down the power button when you plug in the USB-C cable, so essentially, I have to do this every day. It's annoying and almost was almost a deal breaker. I've just gotten used to unplugging it when I take my handheld off the dock, it's nice that it powers off immediately when unplugged, so there's that, I guess.PRO: The new Beats Pill sounds good, it's better than a lot of other Bluetooth speakers I've had. Being in the Apple ecosystem it's nice that it's interconnected with my devices. One not so well-known feature is that you can change the volume of the tones the speaker makes when it turns on or off. Use an IOS device, go into settings in Bluetooth and Accessibility. Having a low volume tone is soo much better!","Reviewed in the United States August 13, 2024",AHRRPRN7Y4X3UP2Z3YN6EWQJCUVQ,True,3,Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+

NO way to turn them off.Also, Apple does NOT have an IOS version of Beats that will support the Beats Pill 2024. Instead, only supports the old Beats Pill+.Totally confusing! Big oversight by Apple.

R2OYAX691GNN4K,B0D4SX9RC6,5.0 out of 5 stars One of the Best Compact Portable Speakers,Student Nurse,5,"I picked this up at the Apple Store the other day when trading in my old MacBook for the college promo (Gift card of $150 with purchase). With my gift card, I decided to inquire about the new Beats Pill that they have in store. One of the reasons I went for this item is because it was essentially free for me ($150 speaker + $150 Gift Card = Gift to me). Below is my review:Sound Quality: In the formative years of the Beats Pill, it has been a very popular speaker to consumers who are shopping for a unit that is under the $300 price tag. Just like the Beats headphones, this speaker is very well known to the general public & even further to the audiophiles (Like Myself). My first thoughts of the sound quality were ‚ÄúHow is this going to sound?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWill this live up to its price?‚Äù & ‚ÄúHow good is the build quality?‚Äù. Needless to say, when I got it up & running, WOW WAS I IMPRESSED!!!!!!This generation of Beats Pill blows every one off its predecessors in the water. The woofer alone is unbelievably powerful with the incorporation of newer & more durable materials. It reproduces great lows along with outstanding mids & highs. As for the tweeter, I believe this was also upgraded. The clarity from the tweeter is exceptional & performs well even at higher volumes.Build: The new build quality is MUCH more advanced than previous models. To start, the speaker is now on a(n) angle to promote better sound distribution throughout your space. The materials used to bring this speaker together feel very durable & solid. In addition to the new build, the speaker offers a plethora of other great features including a(n) IP67 rating, better battery life & a whole new look.Other Comment(s): The only comment I have about this speaker (Which I am sure is correctable by a software update in the near future) is with the on/off function(s). This was a little tricky for me at first, but I eventually figured it out. In order to turn the speaker on/off, you have to hold the power button for 1-3 seconds (I usually do it for 2 seconds & it works). This may be a turn off for some consumers as a lot of people today don‚Äôt want to go through the trouble of having to learn how to turn it on/off the right way.Overall: I would say that all in all, this is a great speaker for under $200 if you are in the market for great sound quality, portability & power. I bought the ‚ÄúStatement Red‚Äù as the ostentatious or loud red color got my attention & I loved it (I personally like speakers with crazy colors / designs). If you are in the market for one, either buy it here or check it out in person. Needless to say, you won‚Äôt be disappointed with this speaker.","Reviewed in the United States September 4, 2024",AFTRAIYZ5AITM2MEV2H2DNAHW73Q,False,0,Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+

R3A0CT3JVYDFX3,B0D4SX9RC6,4.0 out of 5 stars Bass Heavy,Geomancer,4,"As you can probably tell from the product description heavily focusing on the subwoofer, you won't be surprised to learn that this speaker is very bass heavy. That's fine for songs that complement that kind of sound, but is a determent to anything else. For example listening to an audio book it doesn't sound very good and I actually prefer my phone's built in speaker or a regular set of headphones. There is no EQ feature, even if you download the Beats app. Speaking of the Beats app, it doesn't really have any use. It will tell you battery life, and remind you what the controls are, but that's it. The ""one touch connect"" feature did not work, I had to manually connect in my Bluetooth settings (Android, Samsung Galaxy S20 FE).For controls there are four buttons. A power button, multi-function button (play/pause/next/previous), volume down, and volume up. They are the same color as the speaker, do not light up, and are difficult to see. I initially had some trouble turning it off because you have to hold the power button. However if you don't hold it long enough it just gives you a battery life indicator, hold it too long it goes into pairing mode. You have a 2-3 second window between those two functions to actually get it to turn off.Volume wise, it does get pretty loud. Loud enough to hurt if you're nearby. Bass of course travels well and far, be aware that you will annoy your neighbors if your outside with the volume up. Perhaps even at a mid volume because it is so bass heavy. Not great for apartments because of that, at least if you don't want to be that annoying neighbor.If you have two of these, you can sync them together either to just make them even louder (why would anyone want that? It already hurts at max volume), or as a stereo pair.For the price, I would have preferred a speaker with a more balanced audio profile. For tracks that do emphasize bass though it does sound pretty good. Overall I would classify my annoyances other than the sound profile as minor.","Reviewed in the United States June 28, 2024",AHS6VNLQVHWZLOI3RZ6ZXUWPK4OA,False,12,Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+
R31FPPEOE54HHH,B0D4SX9RC6,4.0 out of 5 stars Not bad for the price,M.J. Shearer,4,"I own a plethora of bluetooth speakers, one even costing 10x this one. But, for a small portable form factor, this pill doesn't sound half bad. It is definitely not my favorite in the sound quality department, but the portability factor makes it a keeper. Right now, I'm testing it on my kitchen window sill and it provides me with adequate sound whilst I rustle up grub for the fam. Highs are clear, mids are punchy, bass is present but it won't knock your socks off. If you're looking for a balance between portability and sound quality, then this might be your ticket at 150$. BUT, if you want better sound quality, save up another 100 bux and you can find a larger (even much larger) speakers that will SA-MOKE this one, but, you WILL sacrifice portability. One issue I found with this speaker is that the rubberized texture on the back is a dust and animal hair magnet. (Two cats and two GSD's...you GSD owners out there know the struggle) It will not wipe clean with your hand, but a very damp paper towel works like a charm.","Reviewed in the United States July 10, 2024",AFIPEJWLO34BKCROKOXTQOTHWOIQ,False,1,Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+
R1IDSWYH8GDHSG,B0D4SX9RC6,5.0 out of 5 stars Beats pill returned with an amazing and sleek speaker for IOS/ android,Alan,5,"This is a very small and compact speaker, but for its size, it packs a serious punch. It's comparable to the JBL Flip 6. Sure, that speaker has even better bass, but this more complete package for its price, with speakerphone and in my opinion, more sexy design.-The bass is great, and the overall mid and high range is excellent, but I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs the best among portable speakers. This is overall a very bass-heavy speaker. I only own the black one, but I‚Äôm interested in trying out other models when I get a gold one (because it‚Äôs sexy af).-This is definitely the best-looking and sleekest portable speaker. It‚Äôs minimal, smooth, and easy to carry around. Sure, for the price, you can argue that you can get a ‚Äúbetter‚Äù speaker, but what this speaker offers is a well-rounded package: nice sound with great bass, goes well with home decor without sticking out, and minimal with a beautiful design. It's especially easy to access if you're an Apple user. Speakerphone has decent clarity and nice usages in times.-Even though it says 24 hours of battery life, take it with a grain of salt. The fact is, the higher the volume you play, the more battery it consumes because it uses more power in the drivers and woofers to push out bass and sounds. So, don‚Äôt complain too much if you see faster drainage than advertised, lol. I play around 60%-70% volume range and very bass heavy songs. so I get about 6 1/2 hours from what I observed. Yours might vary.-The biggest critique I have is that it‚Äôs the worst-sounding speaker if you go above 80% volume. The distortion and fuzzy sound are awful. The higher the volume, the less bass you‚Äôll hear, and the highs and mids kick in instead. To be fair, most small speakers are like this anyways. The best volume range I found is 30%-70%, especially 60%, which produces the most balanced bass and highs.In conclusion, if you want a small yet sleek speaker with great sound, then this is for you.By the way, don‚Äôt even compare this to the JBL Charge 5. It literally has different usage, and the size difference is there, lmao. A bigger and more expensive speaker can push out more sound and bass, LMAO. So yeah, it‚Äôs kind of like comparing apples to pears, lmao. I only say this because so many people compare this to the Charge 5 or other bigger speakers.","Reviewed in the United States July 1, 2024",AFASPTXSH53KJIWIFP33WH2XDYXA,False,1,Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+

The battery life is excellent, and easily lasts me through a couple of days of listening. It comes with a USB-C TO USB-C charging cable.I love that this doubles as a speakerphone. I can connect it to my laptop for work calls, and the sound quality is excellent. Beats is a quintessentially Apple product, but don‚Äôt let that scare you off if you‚Äôre an Android fan like myself.

RCS6YZDDME20Y,B0D4SX9RC6,5.0 out of 5 stars The Pill punches far above it's weight class!!,Brian Severn,5,"Beats Pill (2024) is a high quality product, from the Apple'esque packaging, to the incredible sound output from this small [tiny?] Bluetooth speaker. Incredibly easy to use, connect via Bluetooth and your off to the races.This speaker is about the diameter of a Coke can, albeit longer. It has a pre-attached teather that seems strong enough. Claims to be IP67 water resistant. It comes with a small instruction manual and a USB-C charging cable (USB-C YAY!!!). They claim the battery life is 24 hrs, and it may well be as we've been evaluating it for about a week off and on every day and it's still going strong.I tested it via Bluetooth, mainly streaming via Apple Music, and or it's size it packs quite a punch! Decent mids and highs, and it has bass! Not tons of bass [expected for it's size, it's just physics), but it's decent, if not exceptional given the size of this, but that is expected of any Beats branded speaker product, and this one doesn't disappoint! Another neat feature is that it allows the pairing to two Pill units for stereo music. It's easy to control, there are four buttons: power button, multi-function button (play/pause/next/previous), volume down, and volume up.I really like It also has a built-in mic so you can use it as a speaker phone as well, and it works pretty good.In summary, for the price, compared to other ""party"" speakers around the same price class, the Pill punches far above it's weight class, feature sound clarity with decent bass, lots of volume, and simplicity in design as we've come to expect from Beats. While maybe not the cheapest ""party"" speaker out there, it is among one of the best, if not the best, in it's price class.","Reviewed in the United States July 13, 2024",AGMUT4BKXZBD5PKSMOD2QHVHSKZA,False,1,Color: Statement RedStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+

R2W2XN52WGT97C,B0D4SX9RC6,5.0 out of 5 stars HUGE audio punch in a small package - just what you expect from Beats!,Brett,5,"Beats has long been popular for producing audio products - headphones, earbuds, speakers and so on - with great sound that are loud and pack a punch in the form of ""boosted"" bass notes. In that case, this new Pill wireless speaker is more of the same great recipe. In a fairly compact form factor you get a Bluetooth speaker (it can connect with any Bluetooth device though the documentation is focused rightfully on what most people will do - either Apple or Android phones) that gets VERY loud with VERY rich/boosted bass. The audio is also clear for things like spoken word, so that's a positive overall.Outside of that, the Pill is water resistant (not waterproof, so don't drop it in the pool or leave it out in a thunderstorm, but it's okay - probably - if it gets splashed a bit or drizzled on somewhat - meaning that it's great for outdoor parties given the volume) and has solid battery life. I do like that it can act as a portable battery bank, charging phones if you need to. It's not the primary function, but it's nice to see manufactures add value-added extra functionality that doesn't require any extra accessories or things to carry along. The Pill appears to be very well-built and should prove quite durable. As an added bonus, all the packaging is recyclable - kudos to Beats on that!So if you like your music loud and bass heavy, then this is the wireless speaker for you. If that's the case, give it a try today!","Reviewed in the United States June 30, 2024",AGN7FGMJLQ4WZBWMAZMMJYJOFPSQ,False,0,Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+

There is no dedicated power button, and in fact there are no instructions anyplace in the Apple/Beats ecosystem that tell you how to turn it off. (Push the Action button for more than 1, but less than 1.8 seconds.... how dumb is that?) With only 4 buttons, there are too many button sequence combos to remember.

If you don't mind learning a few tricks to use this device it will be great.However, if you are one of those people who doesn't read instructions, get something that is more intuitive to use.","Reviewed in the United States July 19, 2024",AEI3MIZ54YO5TX6CXG6OE5HGGGXA,False,0,Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+

These speakers provide an immersive audio experience, allowing you to truly feel the music and get lost in its rhythm. Whether you're enjoying your tunes or cranking up the volume for a dance party, this speaker is guaranteed to impress. The bass is deep and punchy, adding that extra kick to your music.One aspect that really stood out to me is its portability. Despite its powerful sound output, this speaker is surprisingly compact and lightweight. You can effortlessly carry it with you wherever you go, be it a picnic or a fun beach gathering. Moreover, with its IP67 rating, it's designed to withstand dust and water, making it ideal for all kinds of escapades.Connecting to this speaker couldn't be easier thanks to its Bluetooth functionality. Pairing it with my phone was a breeze, and I experienced no issues with the connection throughout my usage. Furthermore, the speaker offers a range that grants me freedom of movement without any concerns about losing connectivity.Battery life is always a concern when using speakers; however, the Sony SRS-XG300 has got you covered in that department. With a 24-hour battery life, you can enjoy music all day and night without needing to worry about recharging. It even comes with a USB port, allowing you to conveniently charge your devices while on the move.Finally, the design is sleek and contemporary. It's evident that Sony has meticulously considered every aspect, from the construction to the user controls. The LED lights bring an element that enhances the atmosphere and perfectly complements the music.If you're looking for a great speaker for a little more price this is the one. Its the perfect speaker to use everyday whether its inside or out.","Reviewed in the United States July 23, 2023",AEIKMFWY3SV4YRDCG2KL6OTUP4TQ,True,31,Color: Light GrayStyle: SRSXG300/H

It's a little big, and kinda heavy, but the built in handle makes transport a breeze - and it lays flat when not in use. The speaker is very well designed, and looks great. It gets fairly loud, but nothing too crazy. The JBLs definitely get louder, but I like the sound quality of the Sony better. At low to mid volumes, you can get over 12 hours of constant playing from the speaker. At near full volume, it's more like 6-8. If you like how it looks, and are in the market for this style speaker, give it a shot.

This boombox has great features, including TWO USB-A ports so you can use one to play music from a USB stick, and another to charge your phone, plus a mic/guitar input!

First make sure the LDAC is engaged and I also found the live setting to get more clarity and sparkle than the megebass setting and last but not least use a third party music app (I recommend Musicolet) it has multiple EQ band settings and also preamp to boost the volume of your music.With these 3 factors addressed this speaker produces some of the most well-balanced sound of all my Bluetooth speakers especially for its size, just like a fine instrument, it has to be tuned to get the best sound quality from it!!","Reviewed in the United States July 15, 2024",AEBN67HUWEPFLVQN4KCYKDGAWVRQ,True,8,Color: Light GrayStyle: SRSXG300/H

In other words, it changed devices on me without any prompting, and this cannot be controlled.There isn't a way to remove devices that are connected to the speaker, and the app that ""controls"" the speaker is equally unhelpful.

I use this primarily as a home speaker actually that I move around at times, and I think it's a great speaker serving that role, too. I find it impressive truly as an ALL IN ONE product, you know? I must say, even after reviews, this speaker is better experienced in person than the reviews can even show. It's truly impressive. I think when asking if you should buy this or not, the answer is definitely YES if you want the extra features. For example,++ being able to turn this into a guitar amp is gonna make me feel especially cool when I very poorly sing and play guitar. I don't know how often I'll use this, but to have that as an option as actually pretty freaking sweet.++ Being able to charge things from my speaker, even if pretty slowly, is cool and useful.++ Being able to plug in an amazon echo into this speaker and have Alexa voice activated assistance is also freaking sweet. Having such a long battery life is a convenience even just using this mostly as a home speaker.This speaker really does rock! ;) It has numchuck skills, bow hunting skills, it just has skillz. It's NOICE!(I hope this review helps someone in some way. Remember to embrace your inner Napoleon.)which one, you say?You decide!Do you want this even at all AND you have the money? If so, go for it! If you want to spend less and don't mind lacking a few features, (features lik a guitar amp plug, an aux plug, two usb a charging ports, and a super long battery life), consider other options like the Soundcore Motion Boom Plus. You can spend half the price and get something that sounds really, really good still if just having something that plays good sounding music is your primary concern. It will lack some features, but they may be things you wouldn't really prioritize or use often anyway on a more feautre ridden speaker. Being poor, sometimes spending more really pays off, but it doesn't always. Sometimes I'm just as satisfied with a product at a lower price that still has 98% of the other features in common with higher priced items. Does paying more pay off here? Well, I think for the most part yes. I think the features really are fun.","Reviewed in the United States December 9, 2023",AECHBLEF5TE4MITCQKBMC4TNVGWQ,True,19,Color: BlackStyle: SRSXG500

In my house, we own every JBL Bluetooth speaker (Clip, Flip, Charge, Extreme, Boombox, etc‚Ä¶and the different versions of them), we also have multiple UE speakers (Wonderboom, Boom, and MegaBoom), multiple Sonos speakers (Arc, Mini Sub, One SL, etc.), and one Bose speaker (it‚Äôs older, I forget what). Needless to say, I have a lot personal experience with these devices.In my opinion, this Sony SRS-XG300 is about as good as the JBL Charge 3 or 4 (not 5). I was actually surprised at how bad the low end sound is for this speaker considering its size, the bass is just not there no matter how you try and tune it. Using the Mega Bass button is almost laughable because all it does is add bass, without it, there‚Äôs virtually zero bass. The speaker is not room filling at all and can even sound kind of ‚Äútinny‚Äù during certain sounds with higher pitches. It might be great in a lab with specific sound measuring equipment, but in a real world setting, it doesn‚Äôt sound any better than a medium mid-level speaker that‚Äôs half its size.I paid $148 when it was on sale and would say that‚Äôs about the most I would ever pay for it‚Ä¶but honestly I would just avoid it altogether because even if you got it cheap, you‚Äôll be disappointed once you use it.

That being said, I do love having a large portable speaker that I can put in any room of the house and fill it with music or whatever. It's a bit heavy at 5 pounds and should definitely have had a better base for stability because I'm not sure how well it would survive a fall. It also doesn't seem to ever power off despite the settings I chose for that very reason. That being said, the battery life is ridiculously long and I can leave it on all day without any issues.

It got not just wet but submerged in salt water few times when a wave washes through the cockpit. It still runs without issues. Afterwards a give it a rinse with fresh water garden hose.3. Sound levels. It has a great sound and packs a punch. The bass is strong. The treble could be clearer.4. It does have an auxiliary input even though it doesn‚Äôt specifically say that in the descriptions on amazon. Bluetooth works great too and is easy to connect.5. It is larger than the jbl speaker and heavier too but that is to be expected if my other points matter to you too.6. Dont buy the case that gets suggested with the product.

When the opportunity presented itself to buy this unit for under $200, it was an absolute no-brainer. It plays loud. Crystal clear loud with a deep punchy bass to boot! And the battery? Well, we had this speaker at a at rendezvous of a motley lot of characters deep within the twigs of the Nicolet National Forest in northern Wisconsin where it was playing at minimum 12-hours straight with plenty to go and only plugged in on a recharge simply because we were not using it. I haven't tested out the guitar plug-in, as of yet. So I cannot report on that aspect. But the lights are cool especially during nightfall if you're into that sort of thing. Oh, and this unit is certifibly solid. It can literally be dragged through a swamp during monsoon season and it won't miss a beat or soak up a molecule of moisture with its superior water tight design. is great when your spending the weekend in camp or at the beach when a sudden downpour shows up on an otherwise sunny day!

The general use is that it's our garage speaker, the kids use it when playing hoops and sauce toss. I also occasionally take it to the patio. Overall I think it has a much better sound than what it replaced with much heavier bass, in fact it could be a little too much for my taste with some music. The sound profiles help to adjust as needed. My expectations on these were pretty low given they are small battery powered speakers but I am impressed with what it produces. I did find the battery life seems to be just ok. We are charging it more than the old speaker but it could also be that the kids are playing it louder.

It came with the cords and instruction manual BUT the speaker itself had no factory stickers or protective film. I found it odd because everyone knows upon purchasing new products - there is usually SOMETHING (such as a sticker and/or protective film) giving the purchaser some type of assurance that they just bought a BRAND NEW product. But I just tried brushing it off and plugged that baby in. I charged it and played a couple songs but that was it. It was late and so it wasn't until New Year's Eve that I had actually tried out the volume level and ""MEGA BASS"" feature and I noticed the second time I actually powered it on that there was definite distortion or static. My friend who was over noticed it as well. So after playing detective and after watching multiple un-boxing videos of the SONY SRS-XG500 I noticed they all came fresh up outta the box with two blue stickers located on the front of the speaker. MINE HAD NOTHING.I called SONY and they confirmed that it most definitely should have had the new stickers attached. They had me to two different reset features in hopes to fix the sound trouble - but to no avail.They (SONY) is sending me a pre-paid shipping label and sending me a NEW SONY SRS-XG500 from the actual warehouse.

R3BNGB4S06XGRB,B071JN4FW6,"5.0 out of 5 stars Big bass, quality sound and the ability to expand via TWS makes the Soundbox XL a winner.",bazguitarman,5,"After reading/viewing many Amazon and YT reviews I decided to take the plunge and ordered my first Soundbox XL. I say my first for a real and specific reason I will cover futher into this review. After receiving, unpacking, charging and seamlessly pairing my first Soundbox XL I excitedly brought up some music on my Android device.....And I was met with the quality sound I expected after my pre purchase research. While not audiophile quality, the Doss Soundbox XL does deliver high quality sound. The bass was deep, the mids were musical and the highs were pleasant and spacious. The Soundbox XL really does take advantage of it's larger size to create a more spacious than average soundstage and open presence. Overall I found it to be everything it was advertised to be. As far as sound quality it was everything I hoped for and definitely punches above its reasonable price point.Now for the one and only ""negative"" of the Soundbox XL. It's not very loud. It is only slightly louder than my much smaller Anker Soundcore 2 speaker. If you are expecting truly room filling output prepare to be disappointed. While the output is quite a bit louder than conversation level don't expect it to be party level. In that respect I was a little disappointed. That is until I took a realistic and honest look at the speaker and its sound quality. There is absolutely no way that Doss could have pushed the output level any higher while maintaining 40 hz. and lower bass response. Sure the XL has a dedicated sub, but it's not a 12"" sub. Sure the XL has dedicated power for the sub, but it's not 500 watts. There is only so much that you can do with this small form factor. And after taking that into consideration I raised my initial opinion from disappointment to grudging understanding and acceptance.But, I still wanted more output. And that's where the second best feature of the Soundbox XL comes into play. The newest version of the XL features TWS (true wireless stereo) connectivity. This feature allows you to easily daisy chain two Soundbox XL's in true stereo for more output, more bass and even bigger soundstage. So I quickly ordered a second XL and I am glad to report that the TWS feature works perfectly. It really does elevate this speaker system to a whole new level. Now I have the room filling output I was after. And it sounds damn good. The big bass is reinforced and even more impressive. The soundstage is as big as you want it to be. And the sound quality doesn't have to suffer at all. The two speaker units are perfectly synced with no latency at all. I couldn't ask for this feature to work any better. Not only do I get higher output levels but I now have the option for multiple room sound. I am loving this speaker system now.So.....If you are looking for extended bass performance the Soundbox XL definitely delivers. If you are looking for quality sound that is balanced and pleasant it's also in the Soundbox XL. And last but not least, if you want the ability to expand with a second Soundbox XL the TWS feature is a game winner. Whether you want higher output, fuller sound or multi-room capability adding a second Soundbox XL via TWS is simple, satisfying and rewarding.","Reviewed in the United States May 11, 2021",AHW2IWXM3NJJLNRD22WM3LAZ6E6A,True,23,Color: Black
R8POLFK8EAUS0,B071JN4FW6,"5.0 out of 5 stars UPDATE Aug 28 - Great Sound, Disappointing Build Quality",James E.,5,"The DOSS Soundbox XL seem to be plagued either by bad design issues or a high rate of poor manufacturing quality. I recently got one, and took off the cover to remove that speaker grill liner some reviewers said causes a rattle and saw the left tweeter cone was mashed in. I returned it to Amazon only to get a second one with an annoying bass vibration, one recent Amazon reviewer described as a ""farting sound"" with music with a strong bass line. It actually happens at 54 hz when you use a tone generator and comes from air blowing out the jack/slot holes in the back.I really liked the sound, but I feel this needs to be shared. DOSS needs to get it together before I would even consider a THIRD.UPDATE: Aug 29, 2017Within a short time, I got a reply in this thread requesting my email in order to receive a replacement free of charge from Milla with DOSS. Without that, I would have probably not ordered a third.The replacement arrived a few days ago and I am submitting the following update. Milla was quite wonderful sending me updates as to the status of the arrival of the new unit. The first thing I did was remove the grill to check if the dust liner was loose like the first two only to find that it was attached directly to the inside grill. The drivers looked perfect. After charging a few hours, I was ready for my test to confirm if the air leak problem was fixed. I put on a few bass heavy songs and listened for that telltale air leak. As i turned the bass up to the point of distortion, the cabinet seal held. I got no rattles The top trim plate seemed to be secured tighter as pushing down on it detected no movement indicating bad adhesion. This one as far as build quality was perfect.Rather than evaluate the sound in depth right out of the box, my experience as an audiofile knows that it takes a few hours of playing different kinds of music at various levels to allow the speakers to break in and not sound dry and stiff, but more rounded like live music. After two days of playing off and on, the sound difference as they broke in was quite noticeable in the sense of warmth also with an increase in sonic accuracy. I highly suggest one of the better apps for music playback rather than the generic one that comes with your device if you really want to experience their true capability. As an audiofile, listening to various players using my headset was the test.. After trying/buying several, Jet Audio Plus was my choice. I custom built my home PC with a high end audio card including custom opamps, mil-spec capacitor, low noise motherboard, a case that isolates the power supply, routing the wiring, etc. Windows system tweaks, and special software that as a result compares spec for spec and in sound quality with the more expensive audiofile preamps sold separately.So using this app, I have been listening for hours with everything from smooth jazz, rap, rock, and other types also with various dynamic ranges. I will give my impressions based on other bluetooth speakers i have auditioned.Frequency Response: To my ear, this speaker is flatter and more neutral and natural sounding than most. The bass extension is uncanny for a box this size and not only goes lower, but maintains a sense of focus and tightness to actually be able to hear the low notes, not the boomy blur that seems to radiate out of most of the others at this price range. I actually put a little dip in the bass at 60hz because i felt the bass a little overemphasized for my room proportions. The mids were just fine. The treble has a slight roll off due to the dust cover I presume, but it is easily correctable with your player's equalizer with just some minor tweaks above 10k.Soundstage: The Soundbox XL creates a soundstage that occurs just in front of the speaker and has a 3D quality of air, that is missing from most of the others. It is so good that on certain songs you can hear each instrument or voice distinctly in their own ""space"". Also when placed 12 inches from a solid wall, the soundstage blooms to a room filling wall of sound as the back wall reflections contribute to the sense of space and presence. This also increases the bass to a point you can FEEL. This same effect happens placing it in a corner, but i found that 33"" from the center of the back of the speaker to the corner works without overloading the sound with bass.Dynamic Range: After the speaker broke in, i noticed the sound become more alive in sense that as each instrument or vocal in the music became louder of softer, the overall balance of soundstage pretty much stayed flat instead of the dropouts or peakiness you hear with speakers that have a narrow range of accurate frequency reproduction based on the frequency amplitude ""sweet spot"" of each driver. It results in a lack of listener fatigue for extended music listening and as a result is more akin to my home rig sound. Overall Loudness: For most listening, esp indoors, I find the volume range more than adequate. This range can be extended using the preamp setting in the equalizer such as the Jet Audio to levels that go beyond the max that is available on the generic device that is set to protect the internal speaker and earbuds. A step or two up is what i found works best. without significantly increasing the possibility of damage.This speaker ROCKS! If I have to find a fault, it is having readjust the speaker volume each time it is turned on. The speaker sounds better with its volume set at max and controlled by your device. If you do this make sure the volume on your device is turned down a lower range before you adjust the Soundbox XL volume to max.In summary, based on their top notch customer service, better build quality and the other attributes I highlight in this review, the DOSS Soundbox XL, especially at the price point, is 5-Star product. There just is nothing better, IMHO. I can't wait for the pairing option to come and and review a stereo pair! Thanks, Milla.Well done, DOSS!Ôªø","Reviewed in the United States August 15, 2017",AEP6PLVW7LABDSUKZDMRH43CRL5A,True,144,Color: Black
R1C5C7FRCA3FW7,B071JN4FW6,4.0 out of 5 stars A POSSIBLE FIX IF OUT OF WARRANTY - SPEAKER WILL NOT POWER UP,JHelms,4,"I purchased two of these speakers from Doss for bedroom / kitchen use in August 2019. One of the units failed after 10 months of use. Doss was AWESOME and sent me a replacement speaker at no cost. Customer service was great. They did not want the old one back so I decided to have a look around and figure out why the unit was not working. I hate just throwing things away if they can be fixed.Symptoms...- Unit would randomly shut off while plugged in until it would no longer function. Red light on back just blinked next to power cable inlet- While unplugged, it would turn on and off at random by itself powering up and down making the power up and down tones. Would drive you mad with the on / off / on / off tones- Finally, unit would do nothing at all. No soundIssue found:- The internal battery BMS (battery management system) had failed. Battery had no connection at the output. I found no way to unlock this very basic BMS so... it's dead. Unit uses two 18650 cells (nice). I did confirm both 18650 batteries were still good as I manually was able to charge them and check balance. So the BMS just horked out (not the fault of doss, they do not make the BMS or battery pack)I started to look at small replacement PCB's to replace the BMS, then I realized HEY! I NEVER use these things portable. I always have them plugged in. So I tested the unit without the battery pack installed. Nope... No-go. When the circuitry does not sense voltage on the battery connection, it does not allow the unit to power up.I ran some tests and the fix is easy if failed this way. Just solder in two jumper leads from the 12VDC input to the battery connection posts. This allows the unit to power up as it senses voltage even though the battery is not present. I have been running it this way for a bit without any issue. Quick and easy for a solder slinger. See photo for added wire leads. Blue is the color I used for positive.Adding a little video on the tube you can search for to show what I did in case the photo does not cut it. In a few weeks I will be doing some affordable upgrades to this speaker to hopefully get the mid-range and treble in-line with the bass (speaker replacement).BTW, this speaker uses an NTP8320 amplifier / dsp chip. Clearly, Doss did some programming to the DSP's onboard EQ to add this much bass. I wish it was user programmable as this chip has a lot capability.Overall, I feel the speaker is limited by the two super generic 2"" paper cone full range drivers. The sub seems to work quite well in this tiny package with the two passive radiators. I ordered a few different versions of full range 2"" drivers with the same basket so they will be drop in. Hopefully, one of the versions will work better offering more efficiency (louder mid and treble) and some treble extension.For the cash paid, this is a VERY well built little unit. They really spent some time engineering it and most will find the sound adequate for a little room speaker. Far and away better bass than anything I have heard in this price range or even double. Set this unit in the corner of a room and it sounds quite full and much larger than it actually is. Everything from weight, to enclosure assembly is top notch and far better than I expected.","Reviewed in the United States July 4, 2020",AFHAUFM3YV4VIZR6JB5S6EE47LKA,True,22,Color: Black

R38078EFVVGKNW,B071JN4FW6,5.0 out of 5 stars Great sound for price! Well worth it!,tony,5,"Bluetooth speakers are all the rage now going from high end Bose systems to ones that are clipped to your belt and all levels between. Trying to produce a product that stands out of the norm is tough but I believe DOSS has done so with its Soundbox XL. Having bought the DOSS Traveler and using it for river tubing I was eager to get my hands on the Soundbox XL.The XL packaging doesn‚Äôt have the flair as the Traveler. It came with the power supply, AUX cable, and a small printed manual. It‚Äôs not the packaging that sells the product. It‚Äôs the quality build, sound, and ease of use.First off I wanted to look at the build. The speaker is solid in its appearance, weight, etc. The matted finish shuns fingerprints but will pick up a few smudges. The weight at about 3.5 pounds will not let it rattle off the shelf. Another reviewer stated that had the plate around the buttons come off but that wasn‚Äôt the case with mine. There are no visible holes except the AUX, DC power supplier, and TF (SD) card slot.Let‚Äôs talk about the sound. After a 12 hour charge recommended by DOSS I sat down and ran it through its paces. First off I connected to my phone‚Äôs Bluetooth (an easy process) and just played some music to get used to the buttons. I then started up a frequency generator and sent a series of tones through the speaker. To my ears I could hear from about 35hz to 11500khz.I verified this with my Sony Monitor headphones plugged into the phone. Since the ability of hear higher tones goes down with age the younger folks out there you will probably hear a wider higher range. Overall the sound was very good no matter what kind of music I pumped through it. I easily got eight hours of music out of a fully charged battery.I played three hours of classical music at about 30% of full volume. The sound filled the room easily. I pushed the volume to 100% and heard no distortion. I then played another four of hours of rock music. Again I had pushed it to 100% volume and heard no distortion. Keep in mind unless you have your Bluetooth transmitter setup differently the sound will be flat; there are no bass or treble controls on the Soundbox. Where is no audio being played there was a very little hiss.The bottom line. If you want the best bang for the buck, you can‚Äôt go wrong getting this speaker. For moving it around the house, used as a small sound bar for a small TV, backyard parties, etc., it would hard to find something as good as this for the price.

This is so slim yet sounds so good and goes quite loud for its size & with impressive bass, my expectations for a speaker of this size at this price point were blown out of the water. And worst of all, it set the bar so high for my speaker building hobby, that I stopped building speakers altogether for a brief time, because none of my designs at the time had the potential to come anywhere close to the sound quality-to-cost ratio of this.It‚Äôs no bang & oleufsen speaker, but it blows even the old Bose soundlink 3 OUT OF THE PARK, so for the price point, my personal opinion is that this speaker absolutely cannot be beat.","Reviewed in the United States July 23, 2024",AGR5PL73A63NBRDRHGZBFN6RSFRA,True,1,Color: Black
RISA2268RCCEA,B071JN4FW6,3.0 out of 5 stars (EDIT: Mine has had issues.) Excellent speaker. DSP + Subwoofer + Battery! Value at top of charts.,PHIL,3,"I don't have any experience with owning bluetooth speakers, but I have demoed the stuff at best buy. I've owned a lot of hifi though: Magnepan, Stax, Hifiman, and lots more, more than I can remember.I became aware of this speaker by stumbling upon oluv's review while looking for a portable speaker. That dude seems to have heard hundreds of portable speakers, and he measures frequency response and makes binaural recordings. Thanks oluv.The speaker sounds great with a neutral frequency response. The bass is the most impressive part: plays deep, low distortion, and tuned relatively flat. I didn't think that I could get a portable this nice sounding for not much $$ when I first started looking.I just received the speaker today, so I'll probably update this post with more comments, pics, and maybe some measurements.I do have a question for all you other owners. When the speaker is on with nothing playing though, do you hear a hiss/static sound coming through the speakers? Its very low, but discernable within a few feet of the speaker. The sound remains when you play music too but it's not audible over the music. I figure it's normal and am not too concerned, but if it's just me... I get the same static sound in my car's aftermarket stereo with it's aftermarket DSP, amps, subs, and speakers. You can hear it when the engine is OFF and no music playing, but the battery and stereo is ON. At first that noise bothered but eventually accepted that practically it's a non-issue because you can't hear it when the music is playing, then add engine and road noise.I originally bought the speaker for my wife, but I might end up getting two.EDIT: The speaker sounds awesome but the static/hum produced by the speaker is maybe too annoying. It's acceptable for music because its mostly inaudible over the music. But for listening to podcasts while sitting near the speaker the static may be too loud. I'm trying to decide if I should order another to see if I got a bad unit or just returning. Can anybody comment if they have the same issue?Edit: 1star removed. The static is enough to make me not recommend this speaker for low level listening (nearfield). Also the frequency response is a little too much on the warm side. I use EQ to balance, but thats my preference.Edit: 1more star removed. The bluetooth connection to iPhone has been a bit finicky since first use, but generally connected with just a couple tries. Lately however its been getting worse, and just today I couldn't get it to connect at all. So, I tried some other devices and I could get my iPhone to pair with those without issue. I then tried the Doss with my iPad and that took three tries before it would connect. And now, I can't get the MODE button on the DOSS to switch over to another function so that I may use it with my iPhone via aux cable. I am now going to be more insistent on a refund/exchange.","Reviewed in the United States September 4, 2017",AGLVG7GK6XUOWDKYNDJLDWJXGIYQ,True,5,Color: Black
RCEIO0X6YT1NO,B071JN4FW6,5.0 out of 5 stars Better sounding speaker than those costing twice as much,R. Richardson,5,"Great Speaker! I hooked it up to my Echo Dot in our family room. Fantastic sound and volume. Best low bass I've heard in this size and price speaker. I didn't hear any rattling at high volumes like some reported. Bluetooth range is good. I've taken outside to patio without any breakup. The range I tested was only about 20 feet with a wall and sliding glass doors between source and speaker. I play Amazon Music Unlimited via Echo Dot - sounds great!Cons: When I connect with Bluetooth, the speaker disconnects after a period of time of no use. I ask Alexa a question and get no answer and find that I need to turn the speaker back on because it turned itself off. The workaround is to connect to Echo Dot via provided cable. The downside is you need to keep the speaker close to the Dot. But at least it doesn't turn itself off - usually. Sometimes I find it is off and I have to turn back on, but not as often as when using Bluetooth. I keep it plugged in all the time except when moving it to the patio.Another con is there is no equalizer function to adjust bass or treble. Not a big deal as the sound and balance is great.Volume is plenty loud for our large family room. With the volume all the way up, it is too loud. If using for an outdoor party with lots of people and area, it may not sound as loud as some larger speakers.If you want a fuller soundstage, place in the corner of the room. It will improve the fullness of the sound. However, we have the speaker in the center of one wall and it sounds fine.I contemplated the Harman Kardon Onyx Studio 2 larger speaker because my friend has one and it sounds fantastic. I chose this Doss Soundbox XL because of the size, reviews, and price. I am happy with my decision. If you listen to a lot of music every day, you may want to consider the Harman Kardon.You will not find a speaker in this range with the clean bass that picks up bass under 40 Hz. You will hear clean bass down to about 25Hz. The sound is crisp, clean, and deep where you feel it vibrate in you. Most smaller speakers are boomy sounding and make people think they have loud bass. I was like that with my Home Theater setup... I had a 16"" subwoofer that shook the house. I thought I had good bass. Then I purchased a 14"" much more expensive SVS subwoofer and realized what other audiophiles were talking about when they said ""clean bass."" Very crisp, no distortion, short punch without the hollow boom. Makes the music sound so much better.You can read the specs in the description - so I won't repeat here. Suffice it to say, for the size and price, you can't go wrong with the Doss SoundBox XL.You will not be disappointed in this speaker. It sounds much better than others that cost twice as much.","Reviewed in the United States November 3, 2017",AE4NEUMATGXZ32QFZEEMQZGIP72A,True,22,Color: Black
R5H3UJAQNL0TQ,B071JN4FW6,2.0 out of 5 stars Needs some work.,Handy,2,"First, lets start with the size, it's quite large at 12"" wide by 5"" tall. I spent a month digging through every video andreview I could find about this speaker before I finally made the plunge, but somehow this particular aspect of thisspeaker never seemed to make it to the list of things to talk about and of course, I did not actually look. To the average viewer, it seems smaller in size in the videos.It seems very well constructed and unlike many of the older reviews, it does not have the vibrationissue that plagued these in the beginning. In fact, the foam pad, that at first was simplyfloating in the grill and then later glued to the grill, has now been removed all together and I thinkthat this was probably the best way to fix the issue.The buttons are very tactile and they actually took a bit of pressure to respond to my choices.For instance, the volume keys on my unit did not actually work very well at first. I needed to press quitefirmly to get them to respond, but after doing that to all the buttons, it seemed to do much betterand now does not require the firm press.Appearance is simple and has some small issues. First, there wasn't any protection film on the button bar on my unit. I'm not sure if this was missed, or that this is the way they all come. But I did notice some dings and scratcheson the edges of the button bezel that were likely due to manufacture issues. Since this part is very shiny and reflects quite a bit of light, this took away from the ""New"" feel, but was not in anyway a deal breaker. The next small issue is the black high gloss frame around the grill and back. This border is so glossy that it attracts all sorts of dust and hair. I found myself wiping if off many times just in the first hour of playing with it. The third minor issue is the grill. It picks up every little bit of oil from your fingers. If you pick this unit up, (in the only real way to hold it) your fingers will press against the grill. When you set it back down, there is a very dark smudge where your fingers were. It is very noticeable and could be easily remedied by using a fabric cover instead of the semi-gloss paint. I think this would also give the unit a much more pleasing visual presentation and allow it to compete better with other portable speakers in it's class.The unit is charged with a propitiatory 12 volt 2.5 amp round plug charging adapter. This has some benefits and drawbacks. The benefit is that it will charge much faster than a typical USB charger. The drawback is that you will need to keep this charger with you in case you need it. That can be an issue if you don't have a bag to carry it in. The plug felt snug and should provide a long life as long as it is not dropped or banged while plugged in.So how does it sound?Let's start with the sound stage. This is the feel of the sound, and how wide the music coming out of the speaker feels when listening to it. The Doss XL does not have a very wide sound stage at all. For example, I have a Go Groove SonnaVerse UBR sound bar on my monitor for my computer. This is not a very high end sound bar, but does have a good sound stage that allows you to feel like your not listening to your music in a audio tunnel. When listening to the Doss, it seems very narrow in it's sound stage. In fact, you can test this yourself by simply closing your eyes and then taking the speaker and putting it a few inches from your face playing it on low. When you do this, the sound stage is like it should be. But as you move the speaker farther from your face, the sound stage starts to collapse and by the time your arms length away, it sounds like it's coming only from the middle. This severely dampens the ""stereo effect"".The sound Quality. To be honest, after a boat load of reviews of this speaker I had some pretty high expectations, and when I played my first songs on the speaker from my phone, I almost thought I was going to ship it back. I use a paid music app called Power Amp. It is very powerful and versatile app, and has many settings that allow you to customize your sound the way you choose. And on my Sony V600's headphones, it rocks like no tomorrow. But on the Doss, this was not the case no matter what I did to make it come out better whether using Bluetooth or the headphone jack to aux input.One thing I did notice after using this speaker for a day or two is that if you have your phone volume up to 100%the pre-amp in the speaker starts to distort and the speaker sounds really bad. If you turn the phone volume downto 80% then that distortion goes away. I'm not sure if this is an issue with certain types of phones or a bigger issuewith the pre-amp in the speaker. I found that it did this only when using Bluetooth or the headphone jack to aux.Since the volume on the speaker is separate from the phone volume you could turn the speaker volume up to maxand then use the phone volume to control the volume. On the SD card it plays very clean at any volume.But my real reason for buying this speaker was for the TF card reader, or ""Micro SD"" card reader.I use this speaker at work, and I don't keep my phone with me when working So I needed a speaker that wouldplay off of a micro Sd card, and not many portable speakers come with this option, so my options are limited.So I loaded a bunch of tunes on the SD card and let it rip. The highs are still pretty muddy even with some very good quality songs. At this point, it's obvious that this is a tuning issue inside the speaker it's self. Even when using the phone through the head phone jack it still would not allow anything above 8K to really come out. I think if they had made the tweeters angle a bit to the outside of the speaker and adjusted the internal EQ, this would fix both the sound stage and sound issue. I took the speaker all over the house and tried different angles and placements. Putting it in a corner amplified the lows considerably, but also muddied them just a bit. Over all, I was much more pleased with the sound out of the SD card than the Bluetooth, but all three suffer from muddy highs. Also, once past around 1/2- 3/4 volume the bass tends to fade a bit, and you loose those rich lows. I guess this is to be expected though, When it's playing, you can feel the vibrations from that sub and it's pretty awesome. My guess is that this is done to keep it from distorting at high volumes, and also a way to give more battery life.I have only three real complaints about this speaker, and one has to do with your choice of input. When you turn the Doss on, it automatically goes into Bluetooth pairing every time. Even if you were using the SD card or the aux plug in for your source. The minute you turn off the speaker and turn it back on, the speaker does not remember your last input setting, and again tries to pair with my phone. And of course my phone prompts me every time it tries to do this. So every time I turn this speaker on I have to wait for it to start pairing before I can hit the mode button to change it to the SD card input. Thankfully though, it does remember what song I was playing last and continues to play from that point.Second issue is the rubber feet. Seriously guys and gals at Doss. This speaker has some really good bass and will move around at higher volumes. Put some bigger feet with some better grip on the bottom of this thing. The ones that are on there are only a half inch square, and are so recessed into the plastic as to almost make them useless. I took the advice from another reviewer and purchased the SoftTouch Self-Stick Non-Slip Surface Grip Pads - (6 pieces), 1"" x 4"" Strip - Black s from Amazon when ordering this speaker and that fixed that issue.Third issue (and this is the biggest) is the clear lack of good high end sound 8K and above. It really hurts the music and also the sound stage. I can clearly tell most of the high hats and cymbals are being muffled and chopped out.I did a side by side comparison with my low end speaker bar with the same songs and even my wife, who usuallycould care less about sound quality, said she could clearly hear the sound difference.I truly believe that if they fixed these three issues, that this speaker would be almost unbeatable, and worth more money.So, the Pro's and Cons' here.Pro's:Awesome Sub lows reproduction. You will never get anything better in this size anywhere.Good weight to keep it from going anywhere if you use the pads.Visually appealing but a bit dated in style.Battery life is around 8 hours with fast battery charging. Around 2-3 hours for 8 hours of play time at 1/2 volume.Incredible bass reproduction (Yes again). This is where this speaker really shines. It's like having a small sub woofer.Con's:Easily marred by finger prints, dirt and dust. This is not your dirty area speaker.Not water or dust resistant in any way, do not use if you think it will get wet or in dirty environments.No USB charging.High end sound is very muddy and was almost a deal killer for me. Update: Was a deal killer for me.Does not remember input settings when powered up.Rubber feet are a joke.Would greatly benefit from a felt bag or some sort of protective case.My final thoughts. If they would put some sort of rubber casing, even a slip on shell and fix the grill with somefabric, this speaker would be better suited for outside use and look much better and I would have paid more for it.As is, it's more suitable for inside on the go music for maybe your office or such.Also, having the sound buttons have either a different indent or placement would greatly help in findingthem since they are in the middle of the buttons and you have to look to see which one is which.I work in a controlled area and I actually found a zip up bag at my local second hand store thatfit this speaker perfectly for only $1.50. So now when I'm carrying it around from location to locationit does not get all mucked up with dust or get dinged or scratched up.Base reproduction is absolutely amazing at low to almost 3/4 high volume on almost all the music I testedBut the lows come out much better if the speaker is placed in a corner. When putting it in some placesin the house, the lows almost disappeared. So speaker placement is important.If they could fix the issue with the highs, this speaker would be freaking awesome.Many thanks to the reviewers for all their input and especially to Oluv's Gadgets, truly the best speakerreviewer on the internet.Update 8-11-19Sadly, I had to send this speaker back. The missing highs and the narrow sound stage was just too much for me.The speaker had a canned sound that I just could not get past no matter how much I loved the lows.Hopefully, they will read this and perhaps even find someone that can tune the speaker better for them.Till then, I cannot recommend this speaker to anyone.Update: 8-19-19So for a little over $20 bucks more I purchased the Anker Soundcore Motion+ and I can, withoutany reservation at all say that this is what the Doss should have been. Clear highs, even betterbase without the muddyness. USB C 2.0 amp charging. 6,700mah battery with 12 hour play time.Nice rubber casing with a better grill. Easy to find volume buttons.The thing blew me away. This was Oluv's pick of the year by the way.The Doss folks need to buy one of these and compare their sound with it.I think it would really help them to get the sound on the Doss right.","Reviewed in the United States August 8, 2019",AH5V4FGFB6RGWQGFJZAK5MGAHZUQ,True,58,Color: Black
R1CQ8PJG5DQKBQ,B071JN4FW6,"4.0 out of 5 stars vs JBL Xtreme, who wins? I found out.",Kinh Williams,4,"I'm going to tell you right up front, I'm comparing this Doss speaker to a speaker that *normally* cost more quite a bit more than the SoundBox XL. Why? Well, because like many of the reviews have said, including clavinetjunkie whom I respect tremendously as a product reviewer, this speaker punches above its weight class. It's true! This speaker *does* compete against much more expensive BT speakers! And had I not scored this JBL Xtreme, on sale for only $128 (refurb - Frys), I probably would be blissfully satisfied with this Doss Soundbox XL for a bargain of a price and never looked back. Frys sells manufactured refurbished JBL speakers often so it's not like rare deal - Wait a week or two and you'll see the same advertisement. It took them more than once to get me to finally break down and bite. So without further ado, just how did this $90 Doss Soundbox XL compare to my refurb JBL Xtreme? If you're interested, read on.Do you like bass? No really - do you like *real* bass that's normally only produced by an actual subwoofer? The Doss is your speaker. It is downright amazing what this little speaker can do while being relatively so small. There's a ""Test Your Speakers"" video on Youtube by ""Doctor Mix"" and this speaker actually plays sub frequencies at audible levels as low as 20hz! In contrast, the JBL Xtreme doesn't come in until 60hz (and when it does come in, it comes in over-boosted as if to try and make up for the lack of tones prior)! The Doss is capable of playing distinguishable melodic bass tones in your song that only comes out as a repetitive thump in the JBL Xtreme. Rap songs really show off what the Doss SoundBox XL can do. Sounds like a clear winner is Doss right? Again, Read on.Mids, Highs, ""Soundstage"", ""Imaging"" ""Clarity"". All those are, in different ways, related to each other and this is where the JBL Xtreme shows the Doss what it's like to play with the big boys. I played all my favorite songs, ranging from EDM to Alternative Rock, subjected my wife to blind, speaker A vs Speaker B, back and fourth switch tests and it really was no contest. After switching from the JBL Xtreme, mid-song, back to the Doss, it's like the ""it's floating in the air"" wide imaging/soundstage the JBL Xtreme is putting out has been butterfly-netted and thrown in to a small box. That's literally the best way I can put it. For example, take a very vocal song with acoustic guitars in the background, like Paramore's - The Only Exception and switch back and fourth between the two and you'll know exactly what I'm talking about.Build, design, and structural quality: Surprisingly, they take up nearly the same amount of space (see pictures), though the JBL is much heavier. They both require proprietary chargers though the JBL's charger is pushing quite a bit more power allowing you to charge quickly *while playing music*. I know why they rely on proprietary chargers but l wish both could have the option to charge via USB *in addition*. I don't know why they never offer that - seems like an easy compromise and customers would love it, even if the USB option would be slower. Build quality, the JBL is much sturdier, nicer and looks like it would hold up to general wear better. Being water resistant means you can just rinse it off and not worry about it. The Doss has a much more plastic'y feel but come on, you got to remember it's only $90 dollars here. Again, I already warned that this wouldn't be an apples to apples comparison but with everyone agreeing it punches above its weight class against much more expensive speakers, we can't just only talk about the sound quality when we're referring to a ""portable"" bluetooth speaker. Portable means it's going to get a little beat up and the JBL will fair better, provided your kid doesn't stick a pencil to its expose bass radiators on the sides. ;) Also, be careful with the Doss speaker as it produces so much bass, combined with its low weight, it can vibrate and move across the table and possibly fall over an edge and commit suicide. I would add more sticky pads under it and be mindful of where you place it.Sigh... If only I could combine these two speakers. The bass capabilities of the Doss SoundBox XL and the Mid/Highs & soundstage of the JBL Xtreme would be perfect. At the end, I chose the JBL Xtreme. The bass is just as loud as the Doss, but not capable of getting as low however the wide-open soundstage of the JBL Xtreme (superior DSP perhaps) more than makes up for it and just makes music more enjoyable, frankly. Please don't get me wrong: I don't think the Doss sounds bad. I don't think its sound stage / imaging is terrible, I just think the JBL is that much better. In fact, I would say the Doss SoundBox XL is on par with the another speaker I recently fell in love with and reviewed on Amazon against several speakers: the Anker Soundcore Boost (thanks again to clavinetjunkie's review which pointed me back to Anker to give them another chance). I had to knock off one star though. My Doss SoundBox XL has the same buzzing/rattling sound as a few of the other reviewers had mentioned. I know you can take it apart and fix it but Doss really should resolve that before sending them out. It's only noticeable when up close to the speaker (less than 10 feet) so it may not bother most.Overall I do recommend this speaker, I just wanted to give my two cents on how well it does against a more expensive speaker, in this case, the JBL Xtreme. Btw, against the JBL Flip 3, 4, charge 2 & 3, no contest - this Doss speaker is way better as far as sound quality. Again, bear in mind, ruggedness/portability is not the SoundBox strong point.","Reviewed in the United States July 31, 2017",AEFXWNIATB23AKSAQ3PQNRKJ2BGA,True,779,Color: Black

R1RMKRKVIDPT6M,B071JN4FW6,4.0 out of 5 stars Sounds very good but could use a remote and the aptX codec to keep your Mp3s from being re-compressed by Blutooth SBC.,K. Krueger,4,"3/31/2018 UPDATE. The tiny original DC charger port finally snapped. Doss Support replaced the whole speaker and the new one has a larger charge adapter. With no way to charge the batteries I bought an 18650 lithium wall charger and external battery box (see photos). A little soldering, drilling, and some #6 bolts have the old speaker working again;) You might consider any of the following three items as a deal-breaker:1. No remote or phone app, so you have to walk over to adjust volume when playing via micro SD.2. No AAC, aptX, or WiFi to prevent losing audio quality due to compression via Bluetooth's SBC codec.3. No matter which Bluetooth speaker is purchased, you may also need one of these: Azio (BTD-V401).Like others, I immediately pried the front grill off using a small flat-head screwdriver and removed the paper inside. It's just loose and floating around so it makes noise and I am leaving the grill off since it only serves to mute the highs without mellowing lows. Black and unobtrusive plus it is quite heavy for the size. The bass caused it to move three inches and fall off a short step, so the stock feet really don't have quite enough grip. Then it's fairly thin and likely to fall backward onto the delicate A/C plug. After listening for a few days I realized the sound was a little better when aimed slightly up. I wound up building a custom wood frame to raise it a couple inches, lean it back about 30 degrees, and protect the plug.The sound evens out a little after a few hours playing. Bass is especially strong when playing WAV files from the micro SD input, maybe too much! I wish there were an equalizer on that input. If you watch reviews they only use Bluetooth, and to me it sounds like that input received a lot of software refinement.At $89 the sound quality is pretty good when you feed it CD quality files. I describe the sound character as a 'high fidelity boombox'. It's just as loud on battery as with A/C and there is plenty of volume to be had. The only speaker even close to this price which I like as well for its sound, is the 'Creative ROAR'. Honestly, at $99 direct from Creative I would buy the 'ROAR' if I had it to do over. Go to $159 and the 'RIVA Turbo X' sounds very good in surround mode. You can compare all their sounds on Mr Oluv's wonderful site 'interactive speaker audio database'. Without surround-sound, the Soundbox-XL has a fairly narrow stage. This means it is not great for TV and you will probably want to stick with stock speakers there.Paired with a tablet or phone it is far better than those tiny built-ins. The highs and mids are very well done. I am hearing a lot of my Mp3 and WAV files as if for the first time. I keep thinking to myself either, ""So that's how the artist intended it to be?"" or ""Whoa, I never knew they missed a note!"" Acoustic songs like ""Little Martha"" by 'The Allman Brothers Band' and ""Chicuitita"" by 'ABBA' sound beautiful! However, bass heavy club and heavy metal music are just not as lovely. After listening to 100+ songs, drums and bass are perfectly loud but very similar in all songs. I think it has something to do with the limitations of a passive radiator style woofer? This 'thump/pop' effect is most noticable indoors and through the micro SD. Outdoors via Bluetooth the effect is almost unnoticable (again the Bluetooth channel seems to have received the most attention). So, it has proved to be a nice way to fill my large two car garage with music.Offering this speaker at $89 instead of Sony's @$200 price for their SRS-X77 design, means Doss changed or omitted many features. The passive radiators and all drivers (32w) are changed from the original 40w Sony design (neither bad nor good). Removed was WiFi and its high data rate streaming capabilities, Mp3 upscaling, NFC, DLNA, Bluetooth AAC support, and Chromecast. Instead of all that, you get Bluetooth 4.0+EDR vs plain 3.0 in the Sony. I tested the Extended Data Rate feature vs non-EDR Bluetooth using two Android phones. Both connections sound virtually identical when playing either 256kbps Mp3 files or 1411kbps WAV files. This makes sense because EDR does nothing to increase the data rate of audio over Bluetooth and the 'lossy' SBC codec is still being used to compress then decompress the stream. This is where including advanced codecs (AAC/aptX) would have prevented my already compressed Mp3s being degraded further. Uncompressed WAV definitely sounds better than Mp3! As an example, the finger cymbals in ""Easy Skankin"" by 'Bob Marley' lose their highs and blend in after compressing it to a 320kpbs Mp3. So, I recommend using CD quality music files from the micro SD to get the very best out of the, Doss Soundbox XL. I'm still keeping this one as my first Bluetooth speaker due to the lower price and since it met my need for an excellent boombox in the garage.","Reviewed in the United States August 21, 2017",AGEEG22KTHDKDJHOXNATVRQ6MHNA,True,46,Color: Black

R2QSKVZQ7OUYAD,B071JN4FW6,"5.0 out of 5 stars Great so far, I can't really complain especially for the price.",Benji,5,"I have tested out and heard quite a few Bluetooth Speakers and this is one of the better ones and probably the best for the money, although it's hard to say for certain as there is so much out there that isn't mainstream or on Amazon that is high quality but as far as what is on Amazon you really can't go wrong with this, I have some high end in ear monitors for when I want the absolute best sound quality but for the rest of the time a Bluetooth speaker is fine, that's not to say this doesn't put out high quality sound, it's just not as high up on the scale, I also have some high powered bookshelf speakers for when I really want to crank up the music, but this speaker fits perfectly in it's Bluetooth nitch, I'm surprised that they went with such a small battery though, it's the same size battery as my old flip phone that I still use as an alarm clock and it's not big at all. I don't really use it very much on battery so it's not a concern for me but if I were needing to use it a lot on battery I would be looking to replace the battery with something a lot bigger and I am sure there is more than enough room inside. The only other suggestions I have for the next updated model would be a physical switch to completely disconnect the battery for better standby life and some kind of switch to turn off the annoying led that lights up the ceiling at night, some of the high end routers let you turn off the led lights and that is very smart, most people don't need a constant led light on all of the time, they don't even really need a switch, just put it on a timer and if someone wants to see it they just press the power button briefly or the mode button when switching modes otherwise it's completely pointless light pollution. Also on the next model if they can add another subwoofer and have another set of passive radiators on the back that would go a long ways towards boosting the bass, if you turn the speaker around and face it towards a wall the bass sounds much more prominent, most subwoofers are ported out of the back or towards the ground, the passive radiators serve the same function as a port but the slower bass frequencies (in terms of volume as bass moves at the speed of sound but the lack of volume means you can only hear it so far away) combined with the minimal air being moved means that it is only pushed so far into the room and sounds somewhat flat from a distance, obviously much more powerful subwoofers overcome this by pushing hundreds of cubic inches of air every second, but this little 12 watt sub can't do that so it needs to take better advantage of the acoustic properties of the room it's in when inside, outside there's not much you can do.","Reviewed in the United States April 9, 2022",AFLLBNWW2T34Q2BMPZC6ULUPQP2Q,True,2,Color: Black

RLQMNZL8GLN8D,B071JN4FW6,"4.0 out of 5 stars Great sound, good price, wish 3.5mm aux cord disabled Bluetooth",Small Biz Owner,4,"UPDATE 11/1/20:I forget exactly when we bought this, but it's been at least 2-3 years. It's holding up well. For the amount of volume it can produce, the battery life is decent, charging is very fast. I *love* that it doesn't have fancy whizbang colored lights on the front, just tiny little LED indicator lights on top. Pairs super fast on Windows 10 compared to Windows 7. Sound quality is bass-heavy, so if that's your thing, then it's good, but of course any sort of EQ or pass filter could remedy that if you want to. I haven't found the need to reduce the bass while watching action movies.In my review Title, I mention ""wish 3.5mm aux cord disabled Bluetooth"". *If* you plug in the 3.5mm cable before powering the DOSS on, the DOSS will enter bluetooth pairing mode by default, but the moment you plug the other end of the 3.5mm cable into your PC or device, it switches to AUX mode. Or you can simply press the ""M"" button once and when you see the indicator light switch from blue (bluetooth mode) to red (AUX), then you're good to go. BUT, if you power on the DOSS, then plug in the cable to the DOSS, then to the PC, it doesn't automatically switch to AUX mode, you'll need to press the M button once.What could be better I think is not the fault of the DOSS, but rather the current Bluetooth standard. Let's say I watch a movie on the PC, paired over BT. Later I want to listen to music on my phone, also over BT. But since the last paired device with the DOSS was the Windows PC, it keeps looking for that device. It won't finally give up and try to pair with the next device in the list, which would be the phone. I notice this is a universal shortcoming of Bluetooth and it drives me nuts. Why wasn't it Apple that designed the BT standard instead of whomever it was? Because if Apple had designed it (I'm not a huge Apple fan, except for their phones), then pairing with Bluetooth would be a thought-free process...it would just WORK and you wouldn't have to futz around with getting it to connect.Original review:This really does have great sound. Lots of reviews of that here that I won't bore you by repeating. The battery life is mediocre, we can get through about 3 hours of tv/movie watching before it needs recharging. I wish it accepted a standard micro-USB plug instead of what it has.My biggest complaint is how to handles source audio input. Bluetooth is a nightmare to deal with...well it pairs with my iphone just fine, but trying to pair with a Windows PC is not intuitive. It's really more of a Windows issue, though. So my workaround is to simply use a 3.5mm aux cable to plug the PC to the DOSS input jack. It works great when I first plug it in. But if I turn DOSS off and later turn it back on and the 3.5mm cord is still plugged in, it does not recognize the cord. DOSS is still flashing a blue light, signaling it is waiting for a Bluetooth connection. I think it should rather recognize that the cord is already plugged in and switch the source input from Bluetooth to aux-in. The fix is to simply unplug the aux cord from the DOSS and then plug it back in. It's a minor inconvenience, but one that -ahem- Apple would not have allowed if they had designed this thing. I'm not an Apple fan-freak, but I do appreciate some of the user interface details they obviously spend a lot of time working out for a smooth experience.It's a screaming deal for the price, even with that minor design flaw.","Reviewed in the United States November 7, 2018",AFEQXMGFMNX6GFAXKBDL43U3RVAQ,True,5,Color: Black

There weren't many speakers in the market that supported USB/Card playback. I found 3 that had this feature and reached out to their customer support to see if they also do random/shuffle. Coz without random/shuffle, the USB/Card playback feature is nearly useless as we would end up hearing same list of songs every time. DOSS was the only one who responded positively confirming that they do have a firmware update for XL model which would support random/shuffle. and they did send it to me after purchase. But it didn't work. After a few back and forth mails, they now informed that ""there won't be a firmware available for this version of speaker."" While they still offered to take the return, I am posting this here for other customers who might be considering this model for the exact same feature (as it is being mentioned in many online forums). It simply won't work and there are no portable speakers currently in the market for the same.

R2F0IJEIRCGQXR,B071JN4FW6,5.0 out of 5 stars BY GOSH AND BY GOLLY!!!! FINALLY!!!!!!,LynnWied,5,"I received this bluetooth speaker yesterday. I was hoping it would be early in the day as I was set to stream some movies to watch and really didn't want to sit here holding my DOSS sound bar against my chest and next to my ear so I could hear everything. Not really ""conducive"" to pleasant enjoyment of a movie and certainly irritating.IN A NUTSHELL: this speaker is worth the $69.00 and more, I really hesitated to purchase it because of the cost but I want to HEAR when I am watching a movie.The speaker volume and sound is beyond FANTASTIC. I don't think I have even turned the volume all the way up as .... dang, there it goes again, shut itself off. Something needs to be done about that . . . as I was saying before I was so 'rudely interrupted"" by the speaker shutting itself off . . . the volume I have it set at is almost too much and I fear turning it too loud not only because of my eardrums but also I have heard tbat if you turn a speaker up too loud, it will blow the speaker.As I said on my review of the DOSS sound bar, it has delightful sound, it just didn't have the volume I need to hear with my being hard of hearing.I cannot review the bluetooth or the battery life because I just received it. My bluetooth settings on my laptop state that it is paired but I guess that has nothing to do with sound because no sound without the I 3.5 mm audio cable being plugged in. I am not savvy on all the workings of bluetooth connections but it is not important for my main purpose which is to hear the sounds on a movie.I cannot speak to the battery life since I have only used with the power charger. I will most likely keep it plugged in so I do not run out of power.One thing that IS VERY IRRITATING is how this speaker seems to make up its own mind when to just shut off. GRRRRR. So far it hasn't shut off right when I am watching a movie or I might be tossing it out the window, but well ...............I will pair it with my smart phone when I get done with my movie-watching binge.One more thing . . . it is SO NICE not needing to touch the colored wheel to control the volume as was necessary on first DOSS bluetooth speaker, the DOSS SoundBox Touch.","Reviewed in the United States July 27, 2021",AFO6OSFZZVNJJ3FJYV6NPOBADV6Q,True,0,Color: Black

R2YUGBN3YA44YS,B071JN4FW6,4.0 out of 5 stars Spyware? Needs Feet.,Andy Christ,4,"So this DOSS Bluetooth speaker has some interesting features. For one thing, since paired with my iPad, all I have to do is hold down its power button to have it connect and start playing, while which ever other Bluetooth speaker I have on in the house stops. Then once I turn off the DOSS the other last connected speaker starts right back up again. Very convenient, as I don‚Äôt have to navigate to Settings/Bluetooth and go through all the rigmarole of manually disconnecting/reconnecting speakers each time I enter or leave the laundry/bathroom, as I‚Äôd previously had to do with my wired unit. Another thing, the control buttons on top work a treat. Can actually fast forward through ads on YouTube while listening to music videos, something I can‚Äôt do on my iPad proper. (Update: Latest version of YouTube broke this feature, of course. Update 2: Now working again, go figure.) Plus the Volume button functions independently, rather than just controlling the iPad‚Äôs setting the way many cheapo BT speakers do. No controls for bass or treble though and tends to distort a bit but that‚Äôs to be expected from such a relatively small, inexpensive unit. And while the four other BT speakers scattered throughout my abode (a Harmon Kardon Soundsticks, two Mediabridge Concertos and a Sylvania) all sound noticeably better than the DOSS, they‚Äôre also all plug-ins that are larger, heavier and more expensive so no surprise there. (Sorry for the perhaps unfair comparisons but I don‚Äôt own any other battery powered BT speakers, have always avoided them due to concerns over charging life span. Only bit the bullet here because the formerly terrific Sylvania I‚Äôd had in the bath just lost its BT component and did not want to repurchase because of said failure.)Anyway for the laundry/bath this speaker is fine, despite the complete lack of IPX protection (am keeping away from the sink and shower of course). Plunked down atop the front loading washer where, amazingly, it doesn‚Äôt walk around at all, even when maxed out during the spin cycle. Did not remove the metal grill for improved acoustics (as others have suggested) because afraid of eventually damaging the cones with my clumsy fingers; did jerry-rig some temporary feet from Glide dental floss containers and 3M double-stick tape though as the thin rubber pads with which it comes equipped don‚Äôt raise the speaker high enough for proper resonance (and unit still doesn‚Äôt budge.) Finally replaced with rubber stick-on feet:Self-Stick Square Rubber Bumper Pads for Furniture and Electronics .780"" inches (19.8 mm) x .380"" inches (9.7 mm) - 25 pack - BS04 BlackWill update with new pics once I‚Äôve swapped out the dental floss... Okay they‚Äôre on and work great. Super grippy and not so tippy.Incidentally, when initially setting up this device, it asked for access to my Contacts, Mail, FB & Instagram accounts and various other stuff, supposedly for use in a car. This made no sense to me as the DOSS [ostensibly] hasn‚Äôt got a mic and thus can‚Äôt be used as a speaker phone or such, so am assuming its current bargain price is subsidized through spyware.

R4EDYB4ZCUINH,B071JN4FW6,5.0 out of 5 stars It never was that easy to give 6 of 5 possible stars... :-),Doc Henning,5,"It never was that easy to give 6 of 5 possible stars... :-)The speaker arrived in a small plain box. I unpacked the speaker and the charger and charged the battery, which took only 2 hours.I was very curious about the sound - the only service I am interested in a bluetooth speaker (BS).I had tested a lot of speakers between 90 and 150 euro (the prices are comparable to the ones in Dollars in the US). Noone really satisfied me. Some had absolutely no bass. But they built a realistic stage, I had the impression, the music came from beside the speakers. But the bass was missing and voices somehow sounded a bit too sharp sometimes.Others could make deeper frequencies hearable. But it was not real bass. It was ""a kind a sort a"" synthetic. And almost all speakers which could reproduce lower frequencies, had more or less missing treble.The best speaker in this category up to 100 Euro or Dollars was the Denon Envaya mini. Very transportable! And natural sound charasteristics.But for my home I wanted a better BS which should remind me more to a stereo equipment. And in that category, I found the Marshall Killburn, which is my reference up to 200 Euro.Then I read a few reviews about the DOSS soundbox XL. I had had a small ""DOSS Soundbox"" once, which found it's way as a gift to a friend. And the sound characteristics were almost natural, but not enough lower frequencies. But for 30 bucks? It was really good.The XL was sold out in Europe, so I decided to order one in the US via Amazon.The first impression of sound was quite amazing. The bass is one-of-a-kind and absolutely unreached in plastic BS. Maybe also in general.But the treble... I missed some Hi-Hat and cymbals in ""my music"". I couldn't hear frequencies over about 10.000 Hz. I was absolutely disappointed. Again without exception very good reviews and a castrated sound? Then I saw a review with a hint to the fleece behind the grill. I removed it today. And now I am happy! Very happy! This is the best speaker I've ever heard up to 150 bucks! (Even more, it is not very far from the Killburn, which took me 185.) And it took only 90... And the difference without the fleece is huge in my ears! It's like another speaker!At the moment, the speaker is standing on my bed in the computer room and I am listening to jazz music with a string bass. It sounds absolutely natural. It's awesome!!! I love this speaker! Very close to a stereo equipment.The sixth star I'd love to give is for that reference status in my categories. In my ears, the speaker is a ""grand cru"" (french), a great hit!This review is a picture of my perceptions in the sense of hearing. Nothing more. Nothing less.Meanwhile I reinstalled the fleece between grill and speakers. After 3 more days of listening I found out, that the higher frequencies became stronger and stronger and finally were a bit too much and left the natural sound a bit.Now it is perfect. To me that means: the DOSS Soundbox XL needs a couple of hours and days for it's burn in. As some other reviewers already told us.","Reviewed in the United States February 8, 2018",AGVAELBS4F6HC3XK5KXTQZR7IRSA,True,0,Color: Black

He reassured me that receiving two defective speakers in a row was VERY strange and asked for the serial number so he could inform the company so other speakers in that production run could be checked for defects. To correct the problem he is personally pulling a speaker from stock and testing it for any flaws or defects and sending it to me at no charge to make up for all the trouble as for sticking with DOSS. I was impressed with Lu and his commitment to providing a quality product and outstanding customer service. The new replacement is on the way. Received my XL late on Thursday afternoon. Unboxed and put on charger to charg completely before using. On Friday morning, 19 hours later, the charge light on the back indicated it was still charging. I called the Doss customer service around 9AM Pacific time at the number listed in the manual only to get music and and finally an answering machine saying to leave a message and they would call me back. They called me back ( after they had already closed for the day ) and left me a message saying to call them back, which would be on Monday. Soooo, I contacted Amazon and reached Diago in customer service and explained the problem to him. He is sending out a replacement next day air at no charge and issued a return for the defective one.So before boxing the XL up to send back I wanted to at least hear what it sounded like. Inserted a micro SD card, turned it on andHOLY CRAP!! It came on at FULL volume. That‚Äôs when I found out that neither the down or up volume buttons worked. So I turned it off, took out the card and did a more careful look at the unit. Even tho the unit came wrapped in a protective bag, there were smudges and fingerprints on the speaker that looked suspicious. The front middle bottom of the grill has a slight bow to it like it had been bent or someone had tried to remove it. I‚Äôd bet that this unit was sent back to Doss by a previous customer.Hopefully the new one will be without defects and n pristine condition. Then maybe I can update my review and tell you about how it sounds and performs.UPDATE! I received the new DOSS XL early last week. It does have a very good sound ......that is till it quit! After using it twice for a total of 3 hours, it just stopped playing. Lights were still on but none of the buttons would work. I turned it off and it will not come back on even if plugged in to charge. I called Amazon customer service, since DOSS service is a joke, and they are issuing a return and refund. Amazon will only replace an item 1 so I will have to reorder a new one.

R2BAQSCNFB4GP3,B071JN4FW6,5.0 out of 5 stars great value great sound,Larry Ensor,5,"Speaker sound quality is subjective. That being said I have been an audiophile for decades. I have not listened to a lot of portable Bluetooth speakers. My ears have been trained listening to old school systems.My review is based on what I wanted to use these speakers for. Mainly outside, pool, patio area. Pool parties.I bought 2 of the smaller speakers that are popular. Which worked, sounded fine in the house, rooms. But did not cut it for my outdoor use.These speakers are plenty loud enough in a party situation. But not for a big loud party. At least not with just 1-2 speakers. They sound great from distance also. Playing from my pool area they sound great 150 away at the patio. They also sound great when listening from behind them.Keep in mind the quality of the sound is Totally based on the quality of source, the digital file recording. I use apple music and not all digital recording are created equally. Some have a lower sound output then others. Some are much more heavy on the bass or high end then others. I have a very large record collection, lots of albums that I have listened to for years. I know their ""sound"". A lot of digital files are very disappointing compared to the original recording. So don't blame the speakers, any speakers.My iphone eq app works pretty good with these. But I don't fool with it that much. The app is mostly presets. Not much of a true eq with lots bands to adjust.These speakers were very easy to to pair with a smart phone, iphone or not. I wanted speakers with a 3.5m output jack to use with a cheap flat screen TV in my kitchen. Big improvement over what it came with. The speakers easily paired with my apple tv box also.Battery life is good enough for my needs. I want to say around 6+ hours of continuous use at a recent party at full volumeI liked the speaker so much after a couple of days I bought another one. They stereo paired easily.

It turned out the team gave me the wrong how-to guideline for the firmware upgrade, which doesn't work with the UPGRADED speaker. My two cents is that you should carefully examine their how-to-upgrade-firmware email and contact to the customer service if it says ""Turn on the speaker and take the micro SD card out."" You should NEVER take the micro SD card out before turning on the speaker for the UPGRADED version. Then the video attached will happened to you too.Wonders Tech sent me the the second replacement, and I was able to upgrade the firmware successfully. I'm still removing one star because of my time and extra effort I had to spend for the previous two speakers, but now this is a good boy shouting out good sound.Just one thing I want to add is, this speaker is not for someone who wants to listen to music at night while your roommates sleep. It will shine when you set up the volume more than 50, and its minimum volume is still pretty loud to me.I will update my review again if this speaker dies before the warranty is over.--------------------------------------------------------------------My experience about their customer support is pretty same with ToddInVA's review on July 25, 2020.

Play music via TF card in random mode; 4. Combination of 1&2.I chose Number 4. Maybe this is my mistake because this firmware didn't work as they described and just shut down my speaker. I reported this to the customer service, but they just told me to charge the speaker while I already told them I was plugging it on all the time.I got a replacement through Amazon but ended up getting the same result (as the video attached.)

R1XVQCJ4ID7B3Q,B071JN4FW6,5.0 out of 5 stars This speaker has Thunder,Amazon Customer,5,"Amazing Bluetooth speaker, receive my unit 2 days ago I have been testing it out and it is simply amazing I found out about the unit looking at different reviews on YouTube and ran across (clavinejunkie) he did a great review and compared it again some good speakers. I've read other reviews of people talking about the rattling noise or air noise mine's came in perfect working condition the first thing I did was remove the felt that is in between the speaker Grill and the speaker itself as I was lifting up the grill at the bottom I did notice a clear thin rubber strip I believe this is what they did to correct the vibrating problem I didn't lift the grill once I saw it I then got some tweezers and pulled the felt out of the gap that I lift it up on the grill and press the grill back down. A friend of mine brought his JBL Xtreme over and the Doss speaker Bass notes were way deeper, I know the JBL goes down to 70 Hertz but this speaker goes down below 50 hertz even into the 40s with no problem and gave his top portable Bluetooth Bose speaker a run for its money . I tested the speaker out in several locations in my room which is 22 ft by 15 ft and the sound filled the entire room, I have not put it in the corner of my room which from the review says that it sounds even deeper. I have a California king Sealy mattress with a 4-inch cool gel memory foam topper and place the speaker at the foot of my bed and you can feel the bass vibrating the bed. There were some mentioning about the mids and highs could be a little higher however it wasn't a problem with me because the best music player that you can get is the jetaudio premium music player not the regular one the premium have 4 more additional processors that have been developed by some of the top engineers in music business, you can find it in the App Store for Android and Apple, Android users you can find it outside of the App Store buy searching jetaudio plus APK download. You can do so many things with this player that will correct any issues that you're having with mids, highs and there's so many Bass tweets that can be adjust without distortion, look up the features before downloading you won't be disappointed. I only listen to slow jazz music with different low and high tones as well as R&B slow songs the same. I was thinking about getting the Harman Kardon play to go but I am cool with this speaker. Thank you YouTuber reviewers and the ones who have left reviews on Amazon it help me make the right choice thank you have a blessed one. Thanks Doss for working on resolving the vibration issue.","Reviewed in the United States August 4, 2017",AGAT4KQSXA2WTRCSN2MHP4QQDPYA,True,1,Color: Black

R3GHY1U6CZE1A,B071JN4FW6,2.0 out of 5 stars Wait until DOSS specifically addresses the issues and proves it.,Brian David,2,"First off, I have to say that this is a stunning design. I build speakers myself at home and I picked this up to get some design ideas myself. I love the passive radiators they use on this thing! But overall, I was looking forward to testing it out for myself as I had heard great things about this unit and I'd love to have a great sounding portable speaker. Modeled after the Sony SRS X77 and tuned much better in my opinion, picking this up for $89 was a no-brainer and I tip my hat to DOSS for adopting this design. But... It's not quite there yet. The DOSS Soundbox XL suffers greatly from the enclosure not being totally deadened and dampened against the vibrations of the sub-woofer. The passive radiators in place will do their job thoroughly if the box was to be sealed better and deadened completely. Again, This is a great design, It's just executed somewhat cheaply. These currently available units are not deadened enough stop the buzzing fart noises from the ports in the back and the enclosure as a whole. The grill on these models now seem to have additional dampening to address some original complaints about grill vibrations. My units did not have grill vibrations or rattles. In my testing of this speaker, I decided to actually purchase two units and I've now sadly returned them both. I originally listened to Oluv's YouTube videos on this unit and when compared to other units I thought this was a good choice for my intended application. But they definitely suffered from the same issues you hear about in some of the written reviews as well as in Oluv's commentary. The first one arrived and sounded fine in the beginning. With only the loudest techno tracks being played at max volume causing this buzz like fart that you hear about. This began to get worse though over the course of the past few days and as I listened today, it seems like the Soundbox XL wants to literally vibrate itself apart. The buzzing from the back became very noticeable especially with the unit against a wall. It was not like this when I began using it and that was why I picked up the second unit. I really liked it at first. The second unit I bought though was much louder overall. It also had a much more distorted sound at lower volumes. It also buzzed a lot more from the back ports than the first unit. It also had a noticeably louder Bluetooth hum. I had two very different offerings of the same item. Still, with the second unit purchased, the left driver hissed loudly with a static like harshness when playing music and videos. The right driver operated closer to normal but was muted and less clear. This particular unit was obviously internally setup just a little differently than the first one I bought and the little 2 inch main drivers were possibly improperly sealed within their isolated enclosures. I boxed it up pretty quickly for a return as the sound was just unacceptable. I boxed the first unit up today for a return as well. If DOSS would dampen and deaden the enclosure better to eliminate the vibration issues, double down with some back plane absorption material, seal and deaden that back port better, pay stricter attention during the process in which they lay the foam seals around the drivers, specifically the sub-woofer. Then and only then will the Soundbox XL be a winner. Especially when the overall intended sound stage and presentation is easily on par or better than other portable units costing hundreds of dollars more. They should also probably use lock-tight on their screws too.Honestly, the normal listener might be OK with the shortcomings of this portable speaker. They may not even notice. But as stated, I build high-end bookshelf and tower speakers and based on my own 35 years worth of experience. I would stay away from this portable speaker until DOSS specifically addresses the issues that their production practices have introduced to the unit that should not be present.I was truly excited about it and I still want one. It could be the best in class! It looks amazing and if built just a bit better, it would surely be the one to beat... But in the long run, in its current state, I am a bit disappointed.","Reviewed in the United States October 22, 2017",AEFAPNPBK7JZO6PTCVPSCKU5KSFQ,True,105,Color: Black

JEFFREY MCMAHON,4,"I do 5 workouts a week in the garage for an hour and my Android smartphone can be hard on my ears, thin and tinny, so I wanted to buy a moderately priced speaker to keep in the garage. After doing some research, I decided on the DOSS SoundBox XL 32 watts.Pros:1. Black non-nonsense styling is good for my garage.2. Easy to pair with my Android phone. I just went to my phone settings, toggled the Bluetooth pairing on and pressed the DOSS pairing button.3. Sound is a huge upgrade from my smartphone. I played Led Zeppelin's ""Going to California"" and the song was plenty loud. Podcast voices were much clearer and pleasant to listen to over the long haul.Cons:1. The sound quality is not that refined compared to my modestly priced Bose computer speakers, which only cost $30 more.2. While podcasts are fine, the music doesn't have a lot of separation.3. The sound quality on music doesn't match the effulgent praise I read about on all the reviews.4. As good as this sounds, I doubt I'd get one for the kitchen when my wife and I listen to podcasts. I may splurge and get a Klipsch Heritage The One II speaker.Conclusion: Lower your sound expectations for music, since the DOSS won't have the warmth and refinement of Bose, and get if you're a heavy podcast listener and you're speaker is going to be used outdoors or kept in a dank garage.","Reviewed in the United States December 31, 2020",AHDDBWPMHFWK32QXRZD5JOH257OQ,True,0,Color: Black
R1ARB5BP67MM3R,B071JN4FW6,"4.0 out of 5 stars ""And if you don't expect too much from me, You might not be let down""",todd,4,"One of my favorite bands has a line in one of their songs that goes: ""And if you don't expect too much from me,You might not be let down""This line describes this and pretty much any compact Bluetooth speaker ever made.I bought this to replace my tried and true Soundbot speaker that developed problems with the on/off switch and wanted something with a bit more punch. I have purchased at least five of these for family members based on the reviews but never actually heard one until this purchase. I eagerly stole away to my basement lair to open this long awaited package and turned it on expecting sonic pleasure. To my dismay, it sounded flat and lifeless. I almost threw it back in the box for a return, and then remembered that it was intended to go into the bathroom where to old speaker was. Once I did this, I was impressed. Given the smaller demensions and better acoustics of the bathroom it sounded understandingly better. The bass is tremendous, and most songs sound pretty good, however there are many that the vocals or a key passage to a song are very faint. So I tend to listen to what I know will sound good vs what I would like to hear. This is frustrating that most Bluetooth speaker manufacturers just assume you will be listening to urban music and as long as the bass is good, all is well. I would gladly take less bass and a better soundstage. At this price point I realize I am being picky but...... So, for a small room, this would be fine, but to think you are going to push any song in a large room and get a good soundstage you clearly have never had a decent stereo.","Reviewed in the United States May 27, 2021",AFPQJZWQ463BNZQ2HIOQYFIJYIHQ,True,0,Color: Black

I think it fair to focus on the pros and cons of this unit.Pros,Searching for bass from a portable speaker? Search no more, this has more Bass than any of the multitude of portable speakers I've ever heard or owned.Low distortion, even nearing Max volume.No rattles or buzzes except to the objects laying around it, (sincerely, it shakes the entire king size bed I own like a built-in bed massage)Simple to use.Good BT, with decent range.As you increase volume, it digs in its heels and pushes even harder instead of just distorting like most other units.Well constructed, the positive click on the buttons is a nice bonus, very tactile. The entire unit has a solid look and feel.No matter the volume level it produces excellent bass, so you can listen to it on low but still get the feel for the music as the punch is still there.Cons,Heavy on the mid-range, and you will need an equalizer to help tweak that out, a picture of the equalizer settings I use attached.Heavy as a brick, (and larger too)Battery life is short, adding an additional 18650 battery would help here tremendously. But this is to be expected considering the amount of bass and pure volume it produces, you got to put some juice in to get some sound out, and the 2200 milliamp hour battery could really use some help.It needs a little space to sing, it can easily fill a typical room with sound and Bass, it's awfully loud in a more confined space.That being said the unit is designed for bass lovers, it works well across all spectrums of music but is geared more towards Rock/Hip Hop thumping music, but it's still plays all other styles very well.You should buy it, I have paid a heck of a lot more for far more inferior products, it belts out far more bass and volume then even the higher end units.","Reviewed in the United States February 20, 2021",AGOEKUEVP4WJ5X3EQQWIC64GDEXA,True,16,Color: Black

The build is similar to my insignia bt speaker as i had a feeling this design had potential. It just needed more power inside the box to really shine. Doss has made that happen with the Soundbox XL which was a plus as I think this form factor just works with sound and bass response.I placed this in the center of my living room, sat on my couch and instantly fell in love with the sound produced from this little rectangle box. It really knows how produce lows all the way down to 30Hz and even a little further while high as crisp and clear. They really made great use out of the 12 watt sub which can easily be mistaken for a more powerful sub. Seriously, the lows are just amazing! If you ever heard ""bass I love you"" or ""bass I love you 2"" you must find it on youtube and play it though these speakers. I test all my speakers on this track because of the extreme lows and this speaker can really produce damn near all of the lows while the highs still rock easily. Imagine going to the restroom in a club and you hear nothing but bass. That's what this speakers does in my apartment when I leave it in the living room and go to the bathroom. This speaker is really just amazing.Bottom line is the speaker is affordable, loud, battery life is awesome, and the bass response is exactly what I am looking for. It's perfect for apartment living as it is a powerful speaker that does not annoy your neighbors as much. Actually considering purchasing 2 more for the left and right channel on my home theater using line in as its just that good in my opinion. If I could replace my car speakers with this box I would!Update: I use this thing just about every single day and I just love it. The battery life for what this speaker produces exceeds my expectations. It takes power to make this happen and Doss does a great job at it. I have no desire to purchase a Bose BT speaker just to have the same sound quality for way less. I'd definitely recommend DOSS to anybody. I'll be picking up another DOSS product soon for myself and a few for Christmas gifts this year.

I would wager biggest bass by far in this price range and up. You can spend more and not come close to the deep Bass (the powered subwoofer punches way above it's weight sounding more like 100 Watts) and detailed sound made by The Doss XL. Where you see the price is maybe in the cabinet material, while solid and handsome it could have more feel, eg. the hard rubber coating on an Anker Soundcore, or the Tribit XGo. Even so, on the shelf it really looks Premium, sharp, piano black with silver accent around buttons which are shiny and glass smooth. Mine has black grill, looks nice anywhere you put it. Sounds fantastic! Huge fat rich bass and it goes Loud. With a little EQ action it's even better though not necessary. Straight YouTube sounds clean with deep bass, makes low frequency bass that other speakers in this size and class do not.I did not have any issues with vibration, loose parts. Front grill seems welded on. The only thing I did notice is at higher volume a bit of bass I venting out the rear ports, making a slight buzz but *only if you put your ear right next to it. The speaker drowns it out easily. A strip of black tape solved the issue. A lot of ""ruggedized"" speakers have rubber flaps to plug the ports, for aux, USB etc. This one could use a flap, or just some sealant inside. Shining a light in the grill shows it is secured and damped at many points, and I did not see a fabric baffle. Defintely not made on a Monday.Giving Five Stars because this speaker sounds Amazing and especially at the current price, nothing comes close. One more thing, I plan to put thicker foam rubber feet on the bottom to prevent it from moving around when really pumping. Mine has so far stayed put, on a grippy surface, but there are videos of this guy dancing across a tile floor because of the killer bass vibrating the case (which is pretty unavoidable with this much bass). Like having a huge sub in the back of a car, there is going to be some shaking going on. Putting it on fabric or some kind of pad would also keep it from wandering off. At reasonable volume it should be fine.My speaker is well damped with a very heavy duty enclosure, everything tight, does a good job of handling all the sound powering through it.

I own an Anker Soundcore Motion Plus (and several other higher end home audio speakers and systems and headphones) so I'll compare it to that.The Doss is cheaper and has much better out-of-the-box sound. It is hard plastic and has a weight to it that lets you know it is not a cheap wanna-be. The proprietary power cord and bulky design are the only drawbacks I can come up with for this speaker. I love the sound it produces. The separate driver dedicated to the low end makes all the difference. I prefer the the Doss to the Anker when it comes to just plugging it in and using it but the Anker does have a couple more features that make it worth the price. If you do not need USB-C charging or customizable EQ via an app, then buy this speaker right now. In all honesty, it took a lot of tweeking to the Anker Soundcore Motion Plus to get it to sound better to the point where I could notice it. I sleep with my speakers on and the Doss lasts a good 10+ hours on volume a little lower than medium and can last two whole nights on a low volume on one charge. Its heavy but I do not mind the weight.Tldr. Great speaker for the price. No usb-c, but has battery that will last at least a day.

Instead, having received the speaker yesterday, I will focus on my first impressions.It's not clear in the product title but the packaging clearly states this is a home speaker. It is not designed to be thrown in a backpack and taken for a hike or to the beach. The user manual contains the warnings ""Do NOT drop, hit or shake the device"", and ""Do NOT expose the speaker to excessive heat or direct sunlight for a long time"". Also, the speaker uses an AC power adapter that is not compatible with USB chargers used for phones and portable speakers.With that out of way, this speaker sounds amazing! I listen to a variety of music including pop, R&B, funk, hip-hop, early rap, smooth jazz, classic rock, and metal. In every case, the DOSS has a clean, rich, natural sound that I can easily hear throughout my apartment. I especially like that the speaker doesn't rely on a gimmicky bass boost feature to produce exaggerated lows. If sound quality were the only factor, I would easily rate the DOSS at 5 stars. Unfortunately, the speaker's feature set cost the DOSS a star.I bought the DOSS speaker to replace a 20-watt, name-brand, portable speaker that began to buzz and rattle. I primarily used that speaker at home, so a lack of portability is not an issue for me. While comparing the DOSS to rugged portable speakers may be unfair, there are features I consider essential that are lacking. The speaker supports a micro-SD/TF card and buttons on top control playback. However, there is no way to randomize track selection which makes no sense when you can easily have thousands of songs on a card. Also, those playback controls have no effect on Bluetooth devices connected to the speaker so you always have to have your phone, tablet, etc. at arm‚Äôs reach.Right now, I am torn on this speaker.

R1RAWK9GM92GCG,B071JN4FW6,"2.0 out of 5 stars Pretty good sound, poor battery life",Cthulhu,2,"I really wanted to like this speaker, but it has a couple of major flaws. I'll try to go into the pros/cons so that I can keep this review short(ish).Pros:Sound quality- Pretty good sound quality for the price. It's not quite as clear as some other speakers I've heard and can occasionally get slightly muddy, but it performs well for the price bracket. Some genres really bring out this things sound, like rap and some indie and metal. Occasionally it can get a little buzzy and sound a bit artificial, but it performs pretty well. Not the most natural sound. Maybe it's the chip inside.Good build quality- It's not drop resistant and I'd be scared to drop this from any height with how much it weighs, but the materials look nice and hold together well.Neutral:The bass- The dedicated subwoofer really seems to shine, at least at lower sound levels. But the more you turn it up the more it becomes overcome by the mids and highs. It's like the subwoofer constantly stays at one power whether it's low or high, so when the rest of the speakers get turned up it becomes pretty underwhelming.Sound effects- The sound effects aren't the best. The on/off jingle is a bit louder than they should be, and the pairing/unpairing sound is the device connect/disconnect sound from Windows 10. Didn't really bother me but it might bother some people.Cons:The feet- I'm not sure what you actually call them, but I'm talking about the little plastic parts on the bottom of the device that are supposed to keep it from moving or slipping. They don't work very well, if at all. This device puts out a lot of vibration, and the device will vibrate and fall off of surfaces, unless they are very clingy surfaces to rubber, like wood and stone. Tial, porcelain, plastic, etc., will seemingly throw your device off of them.Proprietary charger: This device uses a 12v dc charger instead of the standard micro-usb or the newer usb-c. The only way that you can charge this thing is by plugging it into the wall, which means no charging on the go. This is a deal breaker for people who like to travel with their speakers, or those who plan on hiking or camping with their speakers. Also, no charging your phone.The battery: Holy hell this is awful. The battery is the deal breaker for me. The advertised 10 hours of battery life is incredibly generous, and I have never gotten that much out of it. At medium volumes, I'm lucky to get even five out of it. Most of the time it seems much closer to three. Most of the time I use this in the morning for about an hour while getting ready. I did this for three days, and today I didn't use it in the shower but brought it in the car with me for music on the way to work. It died after about 10 minutes, putting the overall play time from a full charge to dying at about 3 hours 10 minutes, if that. I doubt I used it for a full hour most of those days. Combine this with the fact that you cannot charge it on the go, this device is worthless unless you only plan on using it at home.Pairing: Pairing can be inconsistent. Sometimes it pairs automatically before I can even make my way to my Bluetooth screen, and other times it takes 1-2 minutes or multiple restarts before it allows me to connect.The problems outweighed the pros for me, so I'm sending mine back. I think I'll stick with Anker (or Soundcore) from now on.","Reviewed in the United States March 12, 2020",AGNTA2B53RVNH2Q4T7LNTI7D7DJQ,True,0,Color: Black
R2TM6QZU12H3CH,B071JN4FW6,4.0 out of 5 stars Good natural bass for such a small package. but...,UnNatural,4,"Update as of Sept 2019: I have purchased 8 of these Doss speakers. I kept 2 (running together using a Y cable) and the other 6 I gave as gifts. Out of the 8 only 1 had with an issue where the battery charging wire inside came undone. One of the speakers had a couple loose screws in front behind the metal screen. Other than that, no issues.This speaker has the potential to be one of the best under $400. The bass is natural and not over inflated by DSP enhanced software like most Bluetooth speakers. Unfortunately because it does not have low volume DSP the bass is lacking at levels below 20%. The sweet spot for this speaker is between 30%-60% volume. Within those levels the sound quality is really good with bass playing down to 30Hz. Turning up the volume past 70% cuts the bass back and makes the speaker sound a little harsh. Using an EQ greatly helps, but not all devices have adjustable EQs. The enclosure looks nice, but the bass is too much for it. The whole speaker vibrates, so do not place this on a shelf while jamming and walk away, it will walk itself off the shelf to the floor. Doss needs to add vibration dampening for the entire enclosure and add bass at lower/higher volumes. I opened up my speaker and added 3 layers of vibration dampening material and glued a rubberized sheet on the bottom, now everything works great and it stays in place! While it has its negatives, it is still a lot better than most others at the same $60 or below price range (the current discount price during the time of this review). If you listen to music at medium volumes all the time, indoor or outdoor, and want exceptional natural bass from an actual subwoofer, this speaker is for you.Pros:Bass frequency range (very impressive for a Bluetooth speaker)Enough sound to fill a roomClassy look and button feelCons:Cheap plastic enclosureMissing bass below 20% and above 70% volume","Reviewed in the United States April 1, 2019",AE6XGXTYD27C22JMVZVCGU43Q56Q,True,2,Color: Black
R1ES9FIVJOUNGP,B071JN4FW6,5.0 out of 5 stars This speaker is amazing!!! Get yourself one now!,Corey Furmage,5,"The Soundbox XL Speaker has been getting quite the buzz lately. Sure, Doss isn‚Äôt as popular as other brands like JBL, Bose, UE or Sony. But, I can see that changing very soon. This speaker is amazing and definitely holds it own. With 2 drivers, 2 passive radiators and 1 subwoofer, this thing sounds so good. Has a 2200mAh li-ion battery which gives about 10 hours of run time, but of course this varies based on volume. Connect your phone with Bluetooth or connect with the provided aux cable. But, wait. There‚Äôs more. There is even a slot for a micro SD card, which you can play music that way without even having to mess around with your phone or iPod. Speaker is black with a basic, straight forward design. Not water proof or water resistant, which isn‚Äôt a deal breaker for me anyways, since I‚Äôm not planning on having this speaker out in the rain, or by the pool, shower, etc. Size is about 12 inches long and 5 inches tall, weighing in at about 4 pounds. I would say it lands in between the mid and large bluetooth speaker category. The sound this thing produces is quite mind blowing. Has a nice balance of lows, mids and highs, and actually gets pretty loud, considering it‚Äôs size. All this talk about the speaker, and I didn‚Äôt even mention one of the best things about it, which is the price. $90!!! And it‚Äôs even on sale at the moment for just $60. Most other speakers in this class are around $150 - $200. But, the Soundbox XL is more than half the price, than it‚Äôs competition. This thing is awesome!!! I compared the Soundbox XL to my Sony XB30 Speaker, with a handful of different songs, and the results varied. Certain songs sounded clearer, and more well balanced on the Doss, while other songs had more bass, sounded louder and clearer on the Sony. Overall though, I would say both speakers are pretty comparable. Both have their ups and downs. But, then again, the Sony is usually double the price at $150. So, getting the Doss at more than half the price is a no brainer. In closing, a portable bluetooth speaker of this size and quality such as the Doss Soundbox XL is just way too hard to pass up.

R3NLPJHZFTUUMD,B071JN4FW6,4.0 out of 5 stars This little speaker packs a punch!,Jerri,4,"Ok, so this is the 7th Bluetooth speaker I have ordered over the past few months. Based on reviews and price I thought this just had to be the one. It did not disappoint like the others.The positives are: the portability is on point, lightweight, sleek and doesn't look like a speaker. It has the volume and change the tracks forward or backwards on top. No fumbling in the dark when you want to access it. The battery is on point. It came with the battery partially charged. After a full charge, I still have yet to need to recharge it. I have had it 3 days now. With the volume at max on phone and speaker it is a powerful little speaker. Careful it will vibrate off of hard surfaces. It does allow for multiple Bluetooth connections. However most Bluetooth speakers don't allow it. I would recommend buying 2 of these if you truly want a mind blowing experience. üíãNegatives: No LCD screen to know anything about whats going on. The mode button blinks at different speeds based on which mode its on. The light itself is so very tiny. No remote control. A handle on the speaker would be nice. The bass is not like I read in the reviews. For $30 more you can get the JBL pill Bluetooth (that speakers bass is mind blowing). I am a bass whore. I like to feel my music and I get its a portable Bluetooth speaker).All in all its a powerful little speaker at the price range","Reviewed in the United States January 7, 2021",AFBKQ3HSZP66JL5DNDWMJKP35RIA,True,4,Color: Black
RZXHQMUOZMSNO,B071JN4FW6,5.0 out of 5 stars Great Speaker,Chris,5,"I shopped around for a while before I ordered this speaker. I had had a couple smaller speakers that didn't really do it for me in the bass department. The size, volume and woofer were key in my decision to buy the Doss XL. Speaker is big enough to play in the back yard. In a small room it is super loud. I drive a truck without a sound system, and this thing FILLS the cab. Can't even turn it to full volume! Rap and metal sound great on it. Blutooth sync is solid. I see the loose piece flapping issue mentioned in other older reviews, I can confirm that it is not an issue anymore. I have had 2 Doss XLs now and neither has any sound issues. 5 stars for sound!Another key feature of the speaker is its simplicity and clean lines. it is functional and unobtrusive. Do you want to see your speaker or hear it? Tuck this thing in a book shelf and it disappears. It has kind of an 80's vibe. square and solid. Compare it to an old boom box and you will get the idea. I just wish it had a handle like those old boom boxes.Lastly, I have had the most pleasant customer service experience in my life with DOSS. Speaker worked fine for ~9 months. Then, the buttons stopped working. It could power on fine, but play, pause, volume, etc. just didn't work. I went online for a fix, people mentioned a firmware update. So, I emailed DOSS customer service about it. 20 minutes later, they asked for a video of the issue. Did it. 20 minutes after that they asked for a picture of my serial number and my address. The next day they shipped me a replacement speaker! 2 different service reps wrote to me, and they mentioned talking to techs about the problem. It is obvious that they really care about their product and about their customers. Oh, and I think this all went down on the weekend, like they emailed me on a Sunday! great customer service.","Reviewed in the United States June 14, 2019",AGVT6MSFFM7D555Z3GGZC7RHIDUA,True,4,Color: Black
R2P56A4CZ62SY9,B071JN4FW6,4.0 out of 5 stars Incredible low frequency response for a Bluetooth speaker,M,4,"I've tested many Bluetooth speakers from Sony, Cambridge soundworks, and anker, and have listened many demos of speakers online recorded with binaural microphones and the only other speaker with comparable sub-bass range is the Harman kardon onyx studio 4,which costs twice as much and is arguably less capable than this speaker. This speaker has been tested to produce audible sub-bass down to 20-ish hz. As for personal taste i prefer a brighter eq tuning that makes midrange and vocals more prominent but i wouldn't say this speaker has suppressed midrange.It has a neutral tuning which should appeal to more people. And in any case one can download an eq app to change the characteristics. I just don't find those apps convenient and i wish Bluetooth speakers would provide the eq functionality in the speakers themselves accessible from a smartphone app. But none do so that's not a criticism of this speaker. The only downside of this speaker is the tradeoff for deeper sub bass, it's bigger and heavier than a truly portable Bluetooth speaker. You can't haveboth ways though and i think most people will prefer err on the side of better audio quality.Highly recommended, but first test the speaker at Oluv's Gadgets (you have to use headphones!). Disclaimer: i have no affiliation with oluv's site, but you absolutely have to know about it if you're looking at Bluetooth speakers (in fact, i don't like his reviews. he's a pseudo-audiophile with imo poor taste in music and a huge bias for bass-boosted speakers, but his speaker comparison tool is just oustanding). Another disclaimer is that I tend to listen to these speakers at low to moderate volume with only one or two people in the room. I haven't tested them for party use or at max volume.In summary, i would recommend this speaker to someonewho misses having an audio system with subwoofer but doesn't have the space or budget for that and is not looking to blast the volume of their music.","Reviewed in the United States September 15, 2018",AG2WOI7LAL57QO4KYU5BNYJKEE3Q,True,7,Color: Black
RPAO3JX917PZ9,B071JN4FW6,"4.0 out of 5 stars Refined sound at a great price, but not a boombox by any means.",C. Thistlethwaite,4,"Pros: Solid feel, 8+ hour battery life, and wide frequency response with good low end sound from the 5"" subwoofer.Cons: Not as loud as you might expect from a speaker of this size and power, with very directional high-end frequency response, no equalizer function and poor stereo separation.The DOSS SoundBox XL has a brushed plastic finish and is heavier and larger than most similar portable tabletop bluetooth speakers. It has a solid feel and appears well made. The speaker's strong bluetooth connection and tactile buttons on top of the unit make it an ideal companion to pair with an Echo Dot for a superior streaming audio experience.This is not a particularly loud speaker with it's 32 (peak) watts of power being divided with two 20W drivers and a 12W subwoofer augmented with two passive radiators all facing forward. As a result the sound is very directional. You will stop hearing a lot of the high end response and all of the stereo separation unless the unit is directly in front of your ears. All that said, the refined sound of the DOSS SoundBox XL sounds much better than my Bose SoundLink II, which sells used here on Amazon for over twice the cost of the XL.Other commentors have noted that at high volumes the speaker can actually move across the surface it is on despite the four rubber feet on the bottom of the unit and that the speaker grill can rattle. It is fairly easy to overdrive this speaker, but at normal to moderately loud listening volumes you will not experience any of these issues.DOSS calls this speaker the ""best party companion"", but I would disagree. Instead, check out louder (mono) Rockville ROCKBOX 6.5"" 100 Watt Portable Rechargable Bluetooth Speaker w USB/SD if this is what you are looking for. Otherwise, the DOSS is a great buy.","Reviewed in the United States July 1, 2018",AHJQUCZMF4NADLHXZN77MJSST7RQ,True,4,Color: Black

Feb 2020 - I just need to say........ 2 days ago, my beautiful speaker that I loved so much (yes, this Doss one...) fell off my desk and the quality immediately dropped to a fraction of what it was.............So I re-ordered, got it today, and I noticed that the amazon box was a bit banged up........ and my first thought was.... if my first speaker took one dive onto the ground and then wasn't usable anymore for me................. WHY WASN'T THIS AMAZON BOX LABELED ""FRAGILE""??....So.... I opened it up........ turned it on........ and immediately knew I needed to send it back.Moral of the story........If your Doss speaker doesn't sound incredible right out of the box.......... I'm willing to bet it hit the ground too hard at some point on it's delivery to you............... because my first one..... lol I can't even believe how much I appreciated the sound quality from it...........Maybe needless to say, I have to return this one.*********************July 2019I love this speaker. I've been through so many speakers and headphones, it really is ridiculous........ but high quality, bass bumping, crystal clear sound is one of the most important things in the world to me.......And I'm very happy with this speaker.I also bought the DOSS Traveler....... and though that one is radically different (I mean... it's a LOT smaller...).... I use my big one to play music, and my baby one to play podcasts....... at the same time........ so I get the best of both worlds. I'm learning while listening to music that makes me happy.If you're really picky about high-quality sound that will make you MOVE though...... definitely get the big one instead of the travel version.I'm very happy with this brand, and both speakers.","Reviewed in the United States December 3, 2019",AHBTIGDJWHQ5XODX34YCIRFHYWVA,True,0,Color: Black

R3BX4KFSROT5MI,B071JN4FW6,5.0 out of 5 stars One of the best value for your buck BT speakers available!,G.D. Campbell,5,"Despite my first impressions, this is a fantastic speaker.I was made aware of this speaker by Oluv, of Oluv's Gadgets aka ClavinetJunkie on YouTube. He is a true audiophile.Oluv typically reviews bluetooth speakers that are much more expensive than this one. He spends his own money and typically reviews speakers that cost several hundred dollars, in contrast to this one which cost me $90.When I first listened to this speaker, it was in a large room, and I was basically testing it against the distance I usually use for much larger speakers like the Aiwa Exos9, etc. At first I was disappointed. Later on, I moved the speaker into my kitchen while I was cooking dinner, and the speaker really came into it's own. The bass response is remarkable and the sound staging (for a speaker of this size) was quite impressive.Two caveats: It is not tremendously loud in comparison to many BT speakers, even at full volume. Also, as detailed in Oluv's video it is best to pull the front grill off and remove the fabric liner inside for the best sound. Otherwise the bass will contribute to rattling. With the fabric liner removed it has not been an issue for me thus far. The front grill does not immediately appear to be easily removable, I thought mine wouldn't come off. Just push your fingertips into the recess around the grill and methodically pry. It will come off.Due to the fairly impressive bass response of this speaker, it definitely has the potential to vibrate itself right off of whatever elevated surface you might have it on. So keep that in mind if you don't want it to take a several foot tumble onto the floor.This speaker is apparently a copy/clone of the Sony SRSX77 which costs nearly $300. The difference being that this speaker supposedly has superior tuning to the Sony unit. (I haven't tested the Sony speaker, so this is merely hearsay)Next to the $20 Monster Hotshot, this might be the very best value for your buck bluetooth speaker currently available. If you want to put some smiles on your loved ones faces, buy a few of these to give as Christmas gifts this year.","Reviewed in the United States August 5, 2017",AH7HGRKII63JOKQXYOWH3FIPKCEA,True,7,Color: Black

Lemme tell you the quality of the sound is what I've been searching for in a speaker for YEARS. I'm giving this a 4 star review because after about 8 months of having the speakers it started skipping songs. I tried to see if it was the music app I was using or maybe the device, but it happened with every single music app and device (even friend's devices). I tried to look into this with no luck as to what the source is. I've had this speaker in the same spot in my living room. I keep it plugged in and I dust it so I know for fact there is no water or dust damage or even low battery issues. After the skipping started happening it started turning on and off by its self. Or I would turn it off and it would turn itself on and connect to a device and start blaring music-which wasn't pleasant for my neighbors while I was at work (the sound quality is still beast). Now the speaker only skips on occasion, but the speaker is controlling the sound on my computer. I'm like fighting with a 4-year-old to turn the sound down on my computer while it keeps turning it up or vice versa. It also recognizes that I'm pushing the buttons on it (i know because if I push two at once it makes a computer error sound), but the buttons don't do what they are supposed to do.Long story short I love this speaker and I want a new one, but the technical issues I've been experiencing make me hesitant to buy this same speaker again.","Reviewed in the United States December 8, 2019",AEVLEXKJHF35IJMHB5KYBCE5LJ2A,True,16,Color: Black

This should delete all the paired devices in the speaker, so it won't automatically connect to previously paired devices again.3) Connected to my Mac, IPAD, and Phone and listened to my favorite songs.

For comparison, I have the Bose Companion 2 Series III computer speakers hooked up to my Mac via 3.5mm jack, and using the same track in iTunes, with no EQ on either source, switching back and forth between the Doss SoundBox XL connected to my iPhone via Bluetooth and the Bose connected to my Mac via 3.5mm jack, the Doss sounds noticeably better, even with virtually no stereo separation as compared to the separate Bose speakers (for fairness, I also tested using the 3.5mm jack on the Doss hooked up to my Mac, and the results were the same -- the Doss sounded better). Sound can be pretty subjective between different sets of ears, but I think you'd be pretty hard-pressed to find someone who isn't blown away by the sound coming from this speaker, especially for the price. As an added bonus, it has what looks to be a micro-SD card slot to play music from (it's labeled as ""TF Card"" in the instructions) and the aforementioned 3.5mm Aux jack to hook up an external source, like an Echo Dot.The only real drawbacks I can mention are that it doesn't charge from a standard micro-USB (which may be because it requires a higher power draw than that can provide) and that it doesn't get super loud, although I think the vast majority of people would find that it gets plenty loud enough for indoor and most outdoor usage. It's also not the most polished consumer experience around; it's what I call a ""Shenzhen special"" -- the packaging and instructions are bare-bones and the functionality is basic. That said, pairing with bluetooth and understanding the function modes and buttons is straightforward. I definitely would not consider taking a star away for those minor drawbacks.I first heard of this speaker through Oluv's (clavinetjunkie) YouTube channel, so if you get a chance, check it out because it is a great resource for Bluetooth speaker reviews.","Reviewed in the United States July 14, 2017",AH5CP5CYMTZFKOREZMLCEGZTJF5A,True,70,Color: Black

R3LLBCP9SCEFY3,B071JN4FW6,5.0 out of 5 stars Wow! What a great sounding speaker!,Jim M,5,"Hello people I can see by the other great reviews that I really don't need to add much! I will tell you I compared the Doss soundbox XL with the Bose Sound-link and Sound-link 2. The sound is a no brainier this speaker produces superior sound for the price! The Bose did sound great but is in a smaller enclosure and couldn't produce the lows that the Dose Soundbox XL produces. As for size I wouldn't exactly consider this speaker as compact as far as throwing it in your backpack compact. But for your backyard or room WOW! For 86 bucks this speaker beats anything I have heard in its class! Are there better sound speakers? Probably for a lot more money. One other thing I have read some people complaining about volume. I think it has plenty of volume for its size and it is louder than both Bose I compared it with. Remember this is still a small speaker and if you're expecting a wall shaking experience that one would get from a home surround system it's not happening! I use it primarily in my backyard when I am in my Jacuzzi or having dinner outside and I must tell you I look over at it and just go WOW!!!!Now in 2024 I purchased another Doss soundbox XL to pair in True Wireless Stereo. This is a game changer! The sound is incredible for an already great sounding Bluetooth speaker. Advice to you is make sure your soundbox XL is a version that is compatible with the current version of soundbox XL. Call Doss support if you need help. Speaking of Doss Support, I would like to tell you about my experience with Doss support. Lizzie from Doss addressed my situation and went above and beyond. I had purchased a Doss soundbox XL in Dec,2022 it was TWS but the new soundbox XL I ordered was not a compatible version. I called Lizzie at Doss and their decision was to send me a new compatible speaker and they also gave me a Doss soundbox pro for my trouble.Superior speaker, and superior support!","Reviewed in the United States September 8, 2017",AGCLCTASWXBLLYRFTZHABIFM5C2A,True,7,Color: Black

The speakers themselves sound like they are going to pop like a balloon. I was incredibly impressed with these speakers until this happened. I believe it's gotta be due to cheap parts and I'm not convinced replacements will solve the issue. These could of been great, but far too cheap on the build quality.For the price this BT speaker punches wayyyyyy above its weight class. If you love bass, please do yourself a favor and buy this, better yet buy two and pair them together. I mainly listen to rap and bass heavy music so bass was a must. So before you spend hundreds of dollars on a bigger jbl speaker please give this a try. You won't be disappointed.

RA7AA4FSUX5LP,B071JN4FW6,5.0 out of 5 stars Great sounding and value for money speaker - and even though 1st unit was defective - DOSS after sales service was excellent.,ed reid,5,"The 1st speaker I got was defective i.e. it sounded terrible due to a damaged sub and rh speaker.I contacted the manufacturer and sent a couple of photos and video setting out the problem - and asked for a replacement to be sent directly as shipping the defective unit back to Amazon from New Zealand would have been very expensive..They agreed straightaway and 8 days later I had the replacement unit.I am stoked with the replacement speaker - it has a very clean sound - with a great amount of bass - esp for its size. The soundstage is decent as well and it has more than met my expectations - and fully measures up as per the numerous reviews out there. It paired quickly and the controls work as expected.The sole negative I could find is that it does have a small rattle at some frequencies - but as per the various online reviews - removing the the fabric mesh behind the metal grille fixed this.Note: The volume was bit low for me with my S8 - but this was more a function of my ph's output volume - as I tested it/connected it via BT to my pc and it goes much louder and it still provides a loud - but tight sound.Value for money it is outstanding and I would definitely recommend it.I also want to make mention of DOSS's after sales service given the issue I had with the first unit. They were professional, quickly accepted that the first unit was defective and sent the replacement extremely quickly. They also didn't require me to send the defective unit back - even though the return policy said I did need to - and I am very thankful for this.Highly recommended speaker and seller.

I was initially blown away by the power it produces in the lower octaves - at all volume levels - and the more I listened to it, the more I realized how accurate it is in the midrange and treble tones. Pairing with both my iPad and iPhone was effortless to the point of being instantaneous.My immediate impression of the speaker cabinet was that the materials and controls were substantial, and it was heavier than I expected it would be. The controls are large and plainly marked and have a very positive feel to them. I put the box through its paces initially before attempting to charge it, and it performed flawlessly for the two to three hours I listened. As soon as I found out it is possible to connect two of these beauties in a stereo pair, I ordered a second one so I can astonish my family and friends at our next backyard cookout.Update:I discovered that in order to pair two of these speakers in True Wireless Stereo (TWS) mode they have to be the same model and version. I had to return the second one I purchased from another vendor at a lower price because it was apparently not the same version. I then ordered another one from Amazon and when it arrived I was able to pair the two properly and enjoy true stereo separation from the the pair.

R2ABX9F8PB0KAQ,B071JN4FW6,5.0 out of 5 stars Good sound. Better value than Sony XB40. Really impressed,Raul Lopez,5,"I gave this speaker a try after watching clavinetjunkie youtube comparison and the great reviews.Right away I heard the rattling sound and I removed the loose felt between the speakers and the front grille that people suggested taking off. It definitely helped the rattling sound but you can still hear it with bass heavy music. I listen to a lot of EDM/bass music and the rattle was very noticeable. The speaker sounds great only if it didn't have that rattle when the bass hits.I was willing to give it a ""burn in"" period to fix the rattling but the charging port broke! Theres no way to even test the speaker for an extended amount of time now. I dont know if I received a defective speaker but I will be returning it and maybe try a more reliable speaker.***************Update 11/3/17Excellent customer service from DOSS. I received my replacement extremely fast. Right out of the box the sound was incredible. I didn't have to remove or tweak anything to get the sound I wanted. Music is very clear and has a really punchy bass for its size.I compared it to a Sony XB40 and DOSS Soundbox XL had a clearly better sound signature. If you want pure loudness and flashy lights then the Sony is the way to go. Sony you have to mess with a bunch of settings to get the sound you want. The Soundbox already comes with a very fine tuned sound right out of the box. Comparing the two, to me the Soundbox was the clear choice.I've been testing this speaker over the last month and the battery has been great. Festivals, pool parties, on the road, at home, it hasnt completely died on me once from a full charge. The sound and build quality has also held up.

I've been using 2 of them in my shower for several months, but I really only need one as these get really loud. These are also pretty big, so make sure you have enough space wherever you need to put it. This speaker is pretty neutral focused becoming very bright at higher volumes. Bass is very impressive for the size and I'd estimate it hits 35Hz-40Hz with relative ease in a small space like a bathroom. Bluetooth is okay, but I do experience some dropout and weird connectivity issues occasionally. If the people who made this speaker made a revision, I'd say they should get a better BT chip and maybe tone down the highs. They could also benefit from using better build materials and bracing the inner cabinet. There is a lot of rattling and vibrating with high volumes of bass which causes it to sound a bit muddy. At $60-$80 this thing smokes any and all competition.","Reviewed in the United States May 8, 2022",AHBZEAB6GQQOAGMC7EIROJOKLJKQ,True,0,Color: Black

Get rid of the on/off sounds,Navigatro,5,"I read the reviews on this speaker and watched YouTube video reviews and I got really interested. I got the speaker a week ago and it is awesome. It beats my bose soundlink 3 hands down.There is one thing I do not like about it however. The on and off sound are loud and annoying. I am using the speaker in my office in a professional environment just to keep a nice mood in my office and I play it at low volume. Whenever, you press that on button, the on sound come on at high volume and they are followed by the bt connection sound. I do not understand why it was necessary to have such sounds on the speaker. They disturb people and I have been asked ‚Äú what was that?‚Äù. I wish there a way to turn off these sounds or at least lower their volume. They have the same loudness regardless of the pre-existing volume level. DOSS, please address this. It is an annoyance on a great speaker. I have had to turn the speaker on in my car before I enter the office or close my door to the office just to turn on without disturbing people. Please get rid of them or show me how to disable them or lower their volume. Other than that, the sound is great! I find nothing else negative about this speaker. If you want a great sounding speaker for less than $100, this is it! Just prepare to put up with on/off ridiculous sounds especially if you use it in a professional environment.Update: 11/4/2018 I came back to. Increase my stars on this speaker from 4 to 5 dispite the few cons I had stated. This is just an awesome speaker.

R2V3CYDCZZ3IFJ,B071JN4FW6,5.0 out of 5 stars What a steal!,iEspresso,5,"I got this during some sort of Amazon flash sale for $46, and at that price it‚Äôs a total steal. At the regular Amazon price of $70, I would still be very happy with it though as there are inferior units out there selling for much more. The overall sound quality doesn‚Äôt really compare to a standard bookshelf system, but that‚Äôs not what this is, so it‚Äôs not really a fair comparison. What this does compare to is something like the Bose Wave Radio, and if you‚Äôre considering one of those, stop and buy this instead. The amount of bass this thing is capable of for its size is pretty astonishing, and in that respect actually surpasses the Bose, and the overall fidelity is (like the Bose the first time you hear it) very impressive. The only place where I believe the Bose is slightly superior is in stereo imaging. Due to the close proximity and orientation of the internal speakers this unit has very little (if any) stereo imaging.In response to what some of the other reviews have said regarding distortions or the box not being sound dampened enough, I‚Äôve been using this thing daily for about 6 weeks now and have heard no rattling, or muffled airflow sounds, or anything of the sort. Then again, I don‚Äôt listen to it at max volume pretty much ever. Perhaps such problems show up when listening to loud music at maximum volume, but I‚Äôve had no issues with it playing for extended periods at a reasonable room-filling volume.Granted, if you‚Äôre an audiophile who is looking to replace your Pathos tube amplifier and Focal speakers on the cheap, you‚Äôll be sorely disappointed. On the other hand, if you‚Äôre just looking for something similar to an old-school portable boom-box but with better fidelity I think you‚Äôll be very happy with this.","Reviewed in the United States December 27, 2018",AFO3W4R44JUVWMWFI2YCBWCHDYYA,True,5,Color: Black

R2OYT4Q3B8WMDD,B071JN4FW6,5.0 out of 5 stars Give it some time,Thomas Nguyen,5,"As of this moment, I feel this is a very impressive speaker especially for the price. It has nice deep/strong bass and clear mids/highs. Battery life is excellent and I would highly recommend everyone buy one! However, I definitely would not have said these things when I first received the speaker. I was completely disappointed in the sound quality - it had minimal bass and it honestly sounded broken. Like others have mentioned, mine had rattles and made weird farting noises. I decided to keep it anyway and glad that I did. I've put many hours on it and found that (in my case at least) sound performance definitely improves with more hours of play. It's as if you have to get past a break in period. Oddly enough, all the rattles and farting noises went away too. Keep in mind I like playing EDM and other bass heavy types of music.Something that I've noticed with this speaker is that the room you're in and the surface that you place the speaker on affects the sound quality. For instance, place the speaker in the corner of a room and the bass becomes enhanced. If I place it on the coffee table in my living room, it sounds terrible. Outdoor performance is underwhelming. I think it sounds best in small enclosed rooms. My favorite way to enjoy this speaker is to place it on my bed and lay down next to it - it's an amazing way to experience music with your ears and from the vibrations through your body. Yes, the bass performance is that great, try it!In conclusion, if you find that this speaker doesn't live up to the high ratings and praises everyone has given it, give it some time and try changing where you place the speaker.

R2OI3PUYLYWGO1,B071JN4FW6,"4.0 out of 5 stars Came with a rattle, Woofer eventually started clicking. Still Overall a great sounding speaker.",Joe Blow,4,"First I need to say that this is one of the best sounding bluetooth speakers I've ever owned. The bass is definitely plentiful, but can sound a bit muddy depending on the song. Still, the bass is very impressive and more than adequate for a woofer this size, with 2 passive radiators.Mids, and highs are very clean, and smooth, especially after noting that it's coming from 2 very small full range drivers. Most (even expensive) bluetooth speakers, to me have a bit of breakup in the midrange, that makes them sound honky/shouty. Not this speaker. Mids are smooth as butter, and maybe a tiny bit forward. Highs will confuse you that they're coming from the same small driver as the mids, rather than from a separate tweeter.Immediately after receiving it, though, I noticed there was a metallic rattle coming from the front cover. After reading other reviews, I pulled out the front cover slightly, and reseated it (pushed it back down harder). It takes quite a bit of force, to move the cover but it seemed to have worked. The metallic rattle went away. After having it for a few months though, I started hearing clicking coming from the speaker along with the bass. It appears to be coming from the woofer itself, or possibly one of the radiators. My return window has ended, so I'm hoping DOSS can still warranty this item.","Reviewed in the United States April 7, 2019",AEKJQ64UPSYZDCBI2WGQT6XOBU3Q,True,0,Color: Black

So it seemed appropriate, considering many of the electronic items we've purchased for her over the years tend to just be living in a scrap yard somewhere, in some far away land.I have to say, I fired it up and I was very impressed with the sound quality, it is actually very good, and I consider myself an amateur audiophile, coming from the days when you had full systems, EQ's, amps, Klipsch, Sennheiser, and so on.When I pulled it out of the box it struck me as very solid (Probably due to battery weight), but it's a pretty beefy little box. It has no frills, limited ports and is easy to use. I verified you can use the box with the included power cord plugged in. So that's a plus.The bass is excellent and boomy, the treble is fine and not too much or too tinny, and with the three combined (Bass, Midrange, Treble) it seems very balanced. It can go quite loud as well and not flutter, clip or distort.It was easy to setup and get it paired to my iphone for testing. No problems there.Of course, I played it for my daughter and she was mystified as to my selection of music (Van Halen (fair warning) and some Genesis, (Abacab, Dodo-Lurker)).Sadly enough, the DOSS box has now been commissioned to play Declan McKenna and Troye Sivan songs, here on out..

I didn't plan on having this speaker at very high levels but still wanted a full sound. I use an old Sony SRS BTX300 at home that I really enjoy, but I am not impressed with the new Sony offerings.I originally landed on the Riva Turbo X and was completely underwhelmed by its performance, particularly in the low frequency response. The audio did sound best at nearly maximum output (which was not as loud as the reviews lead me to believe) but still lacked in overall low frequency output. There is also a mobile app to use with the Riva that could not be more useless. I quickly decided to return this speaker.I started my research over and found this DOSS speaker at less than half the price of most speakers I was looking at and thought I'd give it a try based on a few very favorable reviews. I am extremely happy with the audio quality and particularly impressed with the low frequencies this speaker can produce. After 12+ hours of breaking in the cones, the frequency response seems to have expanded even just a little lower - roughly sub 40Hz. I do use an equalizer on most playback devices and this speaker accepts the adjustments really well. I am actually planning to buy a second as one to have around the house and for outside. For the price, I'm not sure this speaker can be beat and I'd say it sounds better than any $200 Bluetooth speakers I've heard recently.My background: Degrees in Audio Engineering and Electrical Engineering.","Reviewed in the United States September 8, 2018",AH2F55Y5LVWF4YJOIXVMEWL4IE5A,True,6,Color: Black

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, it sounds good; especially for the price but it doesn‚Äôt sound great. I had computer speakers with a subwoofer in college that sounded as good or better.What I like about the speaker is the comparatively good sound to the low profile package and price. The bass is excellent. The sound is on par with more expensive speakers.I dislike some of the lack of clarity in the mid range. The bass is good for hip hop but is over powering and imbalanced on classic rock type songs. The stability pads are not sticky/sturdy enough to hold this in place when turned up. You can only leave one device paired at a time. Example: when I‚Äôm done listening to music, I typically just turn of the music on my phone.

R1BK1LNXHAUYS4,B071JN4FW6,2.0 out of 5 stars Amazing sound in a cheap chassis,Darius S.,2,"PLEASE READ BEFORE PURCHASING!This is the second Doss XL soundbox I've purchased. Both have had the same flaw/fate.Box #1 lasted 2 months. Box #2 lasted 10.First off, the sound quality is absolutely superb. LOUD bass, crisp mids, and a very large projection of sound. We routinely used this speaker to entertain guests by the pool, connect to the projector while camping, and in the garage when working on our race rigs.The battery life is fantastic. At full blast, we averaged over 6-8 hours, medium yielded 10-12. Connectivity to Bluetooth devices are effortless. Being able to bridge a set of 2 for more sound is an added bonus.To the bad :( The chassis the speakers are enclosed in just plain sucks. The amount of bass this thing puts out causes it to shimmy and shake around. The foam feet on the bottom do not keep it in place on most smooth surfaces. If you don't keep an eye on it, it will eventually vibrate across the surface and butt up to an object or worse, fall off an edge.This is exactly what happened to both of mine. After an hour or so of use, the speaker would work its way across my work bench and fall on to the ground. The speaker still plays but the mini subwoofer is toasted. They separate from the cone and rattle worser than a square body jeep on a gravel road.Being the DIYer I am, I opened it up to replace the subwoofer. Unfortunately it's an odd size that cannot be sourced, even from China. There are similar offerings but the screw pattern is different.I hated seeing such a good product literally kill itself from such powerful performance.Sound rating +10. Durability +2.

Set it in the back seat and you'll have car filling sound without installing a modern stereo and for mush less money. If you want good tunes in your muscle car I recommend giving this one a try. You can always go for the next model up if you need more bass.","Reviewed in the United States February 25, 2022",AFRVKAYCNHEPJW463AMHYNRH5LJQ,True,0,Color: Black

In that context, this is not in any way shape or form ""audiophile"" but that's not what this cheap little speaker's about; I don't use it to listen to music; fo that I have dedicated systems which blow this speaker out of the water. This was bought as my wife and I scrambled to work online (we both teach voice) so that we could hear more of the sounds our students make as we work with them. And for that, the DOSS SoundBox XL works very well. I'm sure you can do better, but I highly doubt you could do better for the money, or under $100. It has clarity, some bass, and a not too etched or over-boosted top end, which often plagues cheap speakers. If you think I'm damning with faint praise; not so! For the money this little speaker punches above its weight, and I'm sure that for listening casually in the bedroom at night it'll work admirably. if you're looking for a small, easily moved bluetooth speaker. look no further! It connects to Bluetooth quickly every time, and it charges with ease. What more needs to be said?

Patten,4,"The pleasantly surprising thing about the DOSS SoundBox XL 32W Bluetooth Home Speaker is that it does what is says it does. The sound you get from this simple looking box is easily equal to the 2 yearl old JBL Flip that I have. The subwoofer definately makes the difference, though it dominates just a little to much. A little better frequency balance would be nice, but that is a suggestion and not a complaint. The true thrill for me is that it actually lasts for hours with it's rechargable battery. Around the same time I purchased this unit, I got a larger all-weather ""party"" blue tooth speaker that cost 3x more than this one. That box could not hold a charge or work while plugged in, and its replacement worked while plugged in, but would not hold a charge. I am a big believer in backing up your words, and this little Doss speaker does just that.","Reviewed in the United States August 30, 2021",AHQBKCN5RGO37KLPPZGY2VFLH6AQ,True,0,Color: Black

No rattling noises like some complain about. Seems Doss has removed the fabric behind front grill in the new models. Some have said that the highs and mids lack, but not the case with mine. They sound very clear and the highs are not tinny. The bass is very good for such a small speaker, but seems to lessen above 75% volume. Vocals are sharp. This speakers bluetooth pairs effortlessly with my phone. It sounds awesome but is not very loud. It will fill a small to medium sized room though. Sound is very directional.The Soundbox XL will not pair with another XL. BUT, I bought another and received it today. Let me tell you why?I have a Samsung Galaxy Note 8, which has dual audio bluetooth ability. So, you can pair these 2 speakers. Let me tell you. Having 2 of these in stereo is AMAZING! They sync perfect. If your phone has dual audio capabilities, buy two of these speakers! For $120 for two, I do not know of any single bluetooth speaker in that price range that can come even remotely close to the sound that these babies can produce in stereo! As far as long term durability I can not comment at the time. So again, if your phone has dual bluetooth audio, BUY 2 for $120 on Amazon.

It's smaller than the DOSS sleeker and just overall better looking.It even has a larger bottom pad for keeping it in place.Battery wise it also beats the DOSS claiming a 4K milliamps batt. That can also be used as a power bank for other devices.But the DOSS beats it in the BASS...The Aukey has great sound, sharp and balanced with great mids. The DOSS XL suffers in mids with even worse highs BUT it can hit those lows that the Aukey just can't.But for it's size the Aukey is probably better than 90% of other Bluetooth speakers of the same size. Great portability.The Aukey also has a plain micro USB charging port. Unlike the crummy proprietary one of the DOSS XL.The Aukey also has auto shutoff if it sits idle for longer than 5 min.Overall if sound quality is more important to you then the Aukey won't disappoint.Also if versatility is your thing then the Aukey is the better choice.But be aware that the DOSS XL's ability to mini quad...is quite amazing...I mean nobody really quads anymore...","Reviewed in the United States February 12, 2019",AFQG7FWVMQU4XZ64SQXYA4X4RHQQ,True,6,Color: Black

Without asking, once again, they sent me another speaker. That is beyond impressive in my opinion. Sadly, when I opened the box, the same button was broken as last time (see the 4th picture). This time, the button still works, it just is crooked and feels like it's ready to fall in the speaker. They wrote me a kind letter explaining how they talked to manufacturing and hope quality will improve so I am optimistic for their future products. The speakers that work still sound great and are still a deal for the money. If quality issues were resolved, it would easily get 5 stars.EDIT OF EDIT: had it for all of 30 minutes and the forward track button fell into the device. See pictures. Still sounds great and is usable because I just use my Echo for voice commands, just disappointing build quality. This is the second speaker theyve sent me (first one blew the sub). Still sounds great and works, just wish it stayed together!!!EDIT: They sent a new one and this thing one again sounds awesome. I'm impressed with the customer service and once again, the sound quality. Especially for the price. My friend has some high end Harmon/Kardon speaker and this thing gets just as loud and has more bass. Not to mention, it's way cheaper!Original review:This thing is great for the price! When I first got it, I was really impressed with the sound quality. The volume gets pretty loud too! This would be 5 stars except for the fact that after a couple weeks of being connected to my Alexa Dot, it's started to rattle and have no bass. It sounds like the subwoofer is broken.

The sound stage of those speaker fills the room while maintaining a fairly level volume across the area. This is excellent for dinner parties because the it prevents the people near my bar (where I have the speaker) from getting their ears blasted out so the people in the living room can hear. The battery life is easily 9 or so hours on medium volume.The one con with this speaker is there is it appears to have only three main volume levels: soft, medium, loud. It does not get very loud. As you scroll the volume knob on the speaker you will have several regions where there is little perceivable increase before the next volume level is reached.Despite strange idiosyncrasies in the volume leveling, the sound fidelity of the speaker is great! It's not quite the same level as some speakers I've had ranging in the $3-500 range, but hey you're getting close at a fraction of the price!

Unfortunately that‚Äôs unacceptable so I have to return it.Additionally, though we have a small living space, the volume knob has to be turned up all the way (and nearly all the way on my phone as well) to get decent volume out of the thing. That means I‚Äôm not confident that it will provide a great volume of sound in an outside setting. I‚Äôve used JBL (various models) in the past which have a much higher volume without maximizing volume on the phone.Also if you intend to use this in the evening in a dim living space or bedroom at night, be advised the battery bar on the unit is made up of several LED lights (blue and red) that blink constantly while power mode is on.

I originally shopped for a Marshall but I‚Äôll happily take this for a substitute! I previously had Sonos but the WiFi in my apartment provided such an unreliable signal that I had to trade in. The cute vintage style and portable-ness of the Bluetooth speaker makes it a winner all around.As I am typing this, I will say that you have to turn the speaker toward you to direct sound better but if it‚Äôs a small space I‚Äôm sure you won‚Äôt have any problems.","Reviewed in the United States October 3, 2021",AHXFAR4HO3V5FCQ3GN6X3USJWS5A,True,14,Color: Green

R23QBPKBT5QYPO,B09572WYN8,2.0 out of 5 stars In person it appears to be a vinyl veneer (rather than wood veneer). And battery level drops fast.,STW,2,"Good specs and price led me to try this out because I was looking for a wood cabinet bluetooth speaker. In photos online the wood looks decent but in person, up close, it looks like a vinyl veneer. Perhaps that's why it's called ""wooden"" rather than ""wood""?Sounds very good and fills a medium large room surprisingly well. But battery level drops awfully fast, even overnight when off.Love the metal toggle on/off switch (though it's tiny) and control knobs that look like a guitar amp. Fun design but there are better more reliable units this one seems to be copying. But if you were to get one of these, the blue and green vinyl clad versions seem a better value if this ""wooden"" one is vinyl veneer too.","Reviewed in the United States April 23, 2023",AF4WRQCPE2XBSV7OG6GNGSDLH6BA,True,0,Color: Wooden

R3OPHZVX0OPQKG,B0B75RL6JX,5.0 out of 5 stars Surprisingly pretty decent,DG57,5,"Normally my reviews are very short and to the point however this one's going to be a little bit longer. I didn't think that these would actually be worth it but in fact they are. There are extremely many features that are missing on very expensive earbuds. And I'm talking the big brands...First I'll tell you that when you do set up with the app a hearing test it actually does work it helps greatly especially if ones hearing isn't what it used to be. Secondly, as with most, you can set your equalizer to your own personal settings if you want to. The sound, or music, actually doesn't sound awful again I was a bit surprised. Now another thing that is usually a problem for me just keeping my buds in my ears at all times. Well please actually stay in perfectly and they don't hurt one bit and that's using them for at least 9 hours in a row without taking them out. The battery life as far as I know it looks like it might be pretty good unfortunately I haven't given it enough time to judge that but by the usage I have had with the buds they seem to hold up relatively well with ambient on. Basically I'm very satisfied with these I will keep them and hope that they do keep them updated as they should when needed.Now one con is the app is a pain in the butt. It has to always know you're nearby settings it always ask you to have Bluetooth on, which is already on and the buds are already connected before you get into the app. I don't get that one maybe they'll fix it and the other which is unfortunately the case. The case is a bit flimsy and when you want to try to keep the lid open it keeps falling down so I think that that was a architectural design flaw other than that they're definitely worth it I'll get over the case problem all I have to say is if you want them you'll be happy with them.

My previous buds include Bose and Samsung so this is the basis for my comparison. Pairing was uneventful and the Skull IQ app is easy to use. ANC and Stay Aware feature work as advertised. Fit is comfortable and secure. Audio is more than acceptable; especially is you use the Skull IQ app to customize the sound as well as the included hearing test portion of the app to create a personalized profile. For those that suggest there is not enough bass, I recommend using the app to customize the sound and make sure that the buds are tightly fitted. I would buy them again for the price I paid (not sure why but my price was 49.88 new).

R3H10YDL5HCE03,B0B75RL6JX,"1.0 out of 5 stars Allergic reaction, weak app, connectivity issues",Mack,1,"Edit: added more at the endIf you had an allergic reaction to Samsung Buds 2 or their other earbuds, you'll react to these as well. I wore the Rail ANC for less than one afternoon and by dinner my ears were already reacting with liquid discharge. This morning at 4am I had one ear almost totally crusted over and still leaking while the other was leaking but less crusted. I've had this reaction before and I suspect it's the material used for the inserts. Also, the little logo they put on them didn't help either. Anything that causes friction in the ear canal is a stupid idea. I got these for a trip I'm taking on a plane across country and I'm kinda screwed now because I can't return them in time to get something else. My old wired headphones from when I bought my Samsung pgone don't react, so I took those ear inserts and luckily they fit, so I through them on. Once my ears stop reacting and chill out, I'll see if that fixes the issue in time for my trip.As far as function goes, the headphones are okay at best. They can get plenty loud to the point that ANC or their Stay Aware pass through mode mean nothing. It's nice to know I can listen at lower volumes like I prefer and still have ambient noise be mostly audible or have anc keep things subdued. But subdued is the best they give and mostly audible ambient noise is about as much as you can expect. These aren't stellar at either. Doable, but not something I'd laude about.They sound pretty good for what they are. Not sure if I'd say they're $100 headphone quality or value, allergies aside, but they don't sound awful by any means. Music was clear and had some rumble. I used the sound personalization and it was easy enough to get decent sound. There a bass boost, general music and podcast sound setting with a customizable equalizer in the app as well.The buttons on the side are touch activated and finicky. I tend to tap fast and expect fast responses, but these prefer a more methodical pace. The sweetspot for where to touch is also funky, but I started getting it after a few hours. Also, the audio queues are clear enough, but an option to remove them would make things feel faster. Also, if they're not in my ear, I wish touch capacity stopped. Plenty of time I took one out and accidentally started changing tracks, changing volume and activating pairing mode.I remapped all the touch responses and even changed what ear did what. One tap on either paused, double tap on left was volume down, on right it's volume up. Three taps left was previous track and same on the right was skip ahead. Long press in either toggles ANC on/off and pass through audio. I appreciate customization like that.For what stands out as good, I'd say it's the voice prompts. Much quicker to respond than on my phone or watch and that's kinda sad because it's the feature I'll probably never use and cared rhe least about, but seemed so much better than my phones inbuilt assistant that Samsung spent so much time, effort and money on to develop (rip bixby). If you like using voice commands, that's gonna go great, although the ""take photo"" command doesn't work with my Samsung's camera app. Again, not something I was after anyways.One of my favorite features was the built-in tile function for finding them if I lose one or both. The tile app isn't super intuitive, but I mostly figured it out and stumbled my way into it connecting both buds. It creates a tone I can hear when the room in my apartment is silent and has a directional sensor to let me know if I'm getting hotter or colder. Granted, it's not terribly responsive, sensitive or consistent, but if I moved slowly through a room, I bet between the proximity sensor and sound I'd probably find one if I lost one. It's a nice feature to have where I'd otherwise be totally screwed, so I'll take a win where I can with these.I got these on pre-order. When they were scheduled to release after 2 weeks, they ended up coming 10 days earlier or less. It seems weird i had to pre-order when people said they were already at Walmart for a couple weeks, but whatever.I'll update after my ears recover and try them using the non-reactive ear inserts from my old wired heaphones and see if they don't react again. I was furious about my Galaxy Buds 2 causing this reaction, but my wired stuff and my LG Tone Platinums never caused an issue. If it weren't summer and the LG Tone Platinums weren't makeing my neck hot, I might never have bothered looking at this style Bluetooth buds again. But it's a trip to a Nevada training center after the hottest july month on record in human history with averages around 110 in the area I'll be. I thought I'd take a chance on mild comfort. I'm hoping I didn't waste my money now that almost out of time.EDIT: It's been a few days so I'll add more input. Battery is pretty good, but it's not enough to bump a star.The app Skullcandy IQ is awful. It's what controls your key presses. The problem is the app is always on, but loses connection and resets all your programmed key presses. I end up having to reset them every day when they eventually connect poorly. The app logo constantly in my phones notification bar isn't necessary or tell me any input about my headphones. If it at least told me battery levels or connection status, maybe I wouldn't be so annoyed, but this just ISN'T ready for prime time.Also, the ear inserts are what caused the allergic reaction. They jerryrigged replacements I found by chance from a totally different set of wired buds from an old phone work well enough, but I shouldn't have to find my own replacements. At least having an option for different inserts that are non-reactive would be beneficial like memory foam or whatever. Again, Samsung Buds 2 had this EXACT issue and replacing inserts with an aftermarket set was the only solution. For a list of symptoms, it's pretty unmistakable: liquid discharge, discolored mucousal discharge in ear, weeping ear, flaking and scaly skim that seems to build up and shed, pain itching, inflammation, basically a large skin irritation in your ear canal that, if unmanaged, becomes a severe ear infection. Samsung got sued for it and has been paying out for their affected customers. Skullcandy is headed the same way with these unless they have a hypoallergenic replacement in the wing.If the connectivity issue wasn't so bad and not saving my preset remapped button setting wasn't so annoying, perhaps I would add a star or two, but this isn't ready for release and I'm probably returning after giving another day or two. Really sucks I'm screwed out of my trip for headphones, but I'm not gonna struggle with a new set of buds I paid good money for. I'll just go back to wired at this point.","Reviewed in the United States August 6, 2023",AGBD5VMAS2AAPL36TJ7KCLJ6HJNA,True,33,Color: BlackStyle: Rail ANC
R2LT64DQ1X3GZN,B0B75RL6JX,3.0 out of 5 stars Immediate issues,xjarius,3,"I have long been a fan of Skullcandy headphones and earbuds, at least 10 - 15 years. The earbuds were always decent and sturdy, even if you got cheaper ones.My last pair of true wireless earbuds were the Skullcandy Indy earbuds, and I was so sorry to see these were no longer being made.But I was looking forward to the Rail ANC earbuds. First, ANC! Second, a decent IPX4. Third, great battery life. Plus, they cost more, so they must be higher quality, right? So I splurged a little on June 28, 2024. These earbuds sound pretty good. I can tell only a minor difference when the ANC is on and when it's off. The passthrough mode is okay, maybe about as good as the Indy's. The battery life was amazing. That's right. Was. We'll get to that. I loved using the app SkullIQ, where you can customize control settings. I was able to change what the number of taps on the sensor does. Super cool!My list of gripes as of 8/23/2024.First of all, how did my right earbud stop working within the first month? There's a sound when you press the sensor. Within 2 weeks, it started randomly making the sensor pressing sound. Then it started saying Pairing... pairing... as if I was doing long single presses. Then it started skipping to the next track(triple press) and trying to start Spotify* (double press). Within the first month it just wouldn't power on at all. I tried all the tricks and worked with Skullcandy support to no avail. They suggested I submit a warranty claim.*Sidenote: how does it fail to open Spotify whether I'm listening to Spotify or not?).Sometimes they will connect to my phone even thought they are in their case and should be off. My Indy's would do this, too, but it took at least a year or two before that started. This started within the first two months.Every once in a while they wont even connect and you will have to go to settings, forget device, then pair them to your phone again. This is what Skullcandy support had me try to fix the right earbud. Occasionally I need to do this on the left earbud as well. Well if you do this, you have to customize the SkullIQ app again.The case is cheap. My Indy's case was solid and sturdy. It had a few LEDs to indicate how much battery life was left in the case. This new one is flimsy with one light that shows you if the battery is being charged or not.Lastly, the Indy's stayed in my ears much better than the Rail's do. So I'm constantly needing to readjust them in my ears. With a name like Rail, I figured it was made for an active lifestyle. I wash windows for a living, but these things don't stay in my ears too well.As of today, they are in the mail headed to San Diego for the warranty claim. Hopefully, I get a somewhat better product when it's returned.","Reviewed in the United States August 23, 2024",AHV5ROMBVTEEYRVPTVNTHS7P52EA,True,0,Color: BoneStyle: Rail ANC

As far as sound quality and loudness, going from the AirPods Pro 2 to these was like going from ramen noodles to premium ribeye. The bass is right where it should be, and the treble is crystal clear and clean. Loud is an understatement. I use Spotify Premium and am happy with the EQ within that app, but the EQ within the Skullcandy app is really great as well. These are made well and feel great. Battery is roughly 6-7 hours, so really great. They fit great, are very comfortable, and don‚Äôt fall out with movement. All in all, these buds are amazing.

Granted, this is back when headphones still physically plugged into a device or phone. So when I saw these I was super excited. Unfortunately, they ended up being the LEAST enjoyable earbud I have purchased, yet. Before you read further, it is worth noting that a lot of people are super satisfied with these earbuds, so it is extremely likely that this is more about my user preferences not matching with the specs of the item. That being said, the following are the agitations and the positives I‚Äôve experienced since using them:THE CONS:‚Ä¢ The earbuds regularly don‚Äôt sync with my phone & I am prompted at least 3x a week to ‚Äúforget‚Äù the earbuds and then go through the pairing process again. Not a huge problem, but a mild inconvenience made worse by the regularity in which it happens.‚Ä¢ The earbuds fall out of my ears from my jaw moving, which happens often, because my jaw moves when I talk on the phone.‚Ä¢ The earbuds require an app to be downloaded to my phone, in order to customize each button sequence to the desired function (I.e. answer phone, play music, skip forward, etc.). The frustration I have with this is that the earbuds can answer a phone call with a tap, but they cannot end the call with a tap. So, in order to hang up, I have to use my phone screen (or wait for the person I‚Äôm talking with to hang up).‚Ä¢ The earbuds verbalize information about the device, each time you put them in your ear. I can see how some people might prefer this, but I prefer just a simple one or two note ‚Äúchime‚Äù to let me know the earbud is connected to the device. These earbuds state the following, each time I put them in: *chime*‚Ä¶ pause‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúBattery at __%‚Äù‚Ä¶ pause‚Ä¶ ‚Äúconnected‚Äù. This will happen, even if you‚Äôre listening to music or are actively talking on the phone & you swap earbuds. Again, not a huge problem, but a frequent nuisance.THE PROS:Now, despite these gripes, I will say that the sound quality of both phone calls and music are REALLY good (for the price of the earbud). Moreover, I have used AirPods, Beats Pro, and JBL earbuds‚Ä¶ and I have had a few people tell me that the sound quality of my voice for them (when on the phone) is noticeably better. I did not ask these people before hand, they voiced it on their own accord. One person even said ‚Äúdid you get new headphones?! I can hear you so much better now!‚Äù.

The sound quality is amazing, I absolutely adore the ‚Äúpersonal sound‚Äù through the app it uses. It connects really easily, barely a hassle. I like the added features, like how it can connect to Spotify instantly and play from the earbuds, or how it can detect whether or not you‚Äôre listening to an audiobook/podcast and adjust volumes accordingly. I also like the noise cancelling, it has a slider where you can adjust how much or how little you‚Äôd want. Overall, when it comes to the sound, it knocks it out of the ballpark.Though, one of my only gripes with it is the fit. It wasn‚Äôt built for movement. Even walking around with it indoors, it tends to pop out unless I continually push it back in. I‚Äôve tried the multiple ear tips provided, but it doesn‚Äôt seem to help much. The other gripe I have with it is the controls, and how sensitive it is. Remember how I mentioned I have to continually push it back in? Well, 9/10 times I‚Äôll accidentally pause the song, skip, or start pairing mode. The touch controls are nice, but I wish it wasn‚Äôt as sensitive, because the slightest poke sends it into a frenzy.Overall, it‚Äôs amazing if you‚Äôre just using it at home, stationary. The sound and battery life is phenomenal. If you plan to use it on the go, walking to and from places, etc. I‚Äôd advise to go elsewhere.","Reviewed in the United States March 1, 2024",AH35JWVQOH6GNEOZ5AXBB7EH5S3A,True,8,Color: BlackStyle: Rail ANC

R1WYQTTEJ2W6P9,B0B75RL6JX,2.0 out of 5 stars Disappointing,Bandito,2,"I am a big fan of the SC line of ear buds. Let's get that out of the way. I own a set of Grind and Push Active, currently, and the case for the Push stopped charging, which is why I am here.I had really high hopes for these and was really let down. I purchased a set (XT) from Walmart and they sounded terrible. I returned them and saw these on sale and got them, thinking they might be different. The Walmart set was tagged with the 'XT' qualifier, so I didn't know if there were different components used in them.There aren't.1. I feel like I have average sized hands for a dude, so I don't know why I seem to fumble with getting the buds out and into the case. And when I say fumble, I'm talking about the kind of fumble that causes them to fall down a storm drain 10 feet away. I have had to hunt them down because they shot across the room when getting them out. I don't do that with my other sets. I feel like its my technique, but I dont know what the right one is...2. Touch Sensitivity is off the charts. I cannot turn up the volume, turn on ANC or anything else without accidentally pausing what I am listening to, EVERY SINGLE TIME. If you want to take one out to talk to someone, don't hold it in your hand. Now my boss knows I listen to Hailee Steinfeld, and SkullCandy is to blame. 100%. Thanks... I stopped using this feature, I lost patience and went back to doing everything on my phone. This may be a ""give it time"" thing or maybe making pause/play three taps is the answer.3. The sound. It's kinda bad... especially when you get up in volume. Even at about 75% I can hear distortion and they're no louder than my other sets at 75%. This is why I returned the XT to Walmart, because of this distortion. I do not have this issue with the Grind or Push Active, even at 100%.I don't know what happened.The positives:1. The announcement is toned down and less obtrusive. So if someone calls and I want to put them in, I dont have to pause my convo for 45 seconds. I can hear over it enough now to understand what's being said.2. The bass on them is really f'in nice, which is what I wanted when I bought these. I think this is the trade-off with distortion though, which is a major bummer. I will say that when these things get rockin with a nice bass track that doesn't distort, they can wiggle themselves right out of your ear. All you have to do is push them back in...pause...","Reviewed in the United States June 19, 2024",AGMO6CYINLL4ZTWZS7VP5Z3AB5VQ,True,0,Color: BlackStyle: Rail ANC

Up until today (3/5/2024), when this review is being written, ownership has been fantastic. The Rail ANC earbuds performed effortlessly and are light-years ahead of my previous earbuds from Gravastar. However, one earbud, the left specifically, has ceased to emit any sound. Its touch and ANC features still operate, but there is zero sound emitted through the speaker. This is the first time an earbud or similar device has done this in my experience, and while I know nothing is perfect forever, but I am wondering how it happened. I have my volume set to its lowest setting and do not drop, abuse, or otherwise mistreat the device. When not in use, both earbuds are stored in the charging case. I should also add that I did attempt to pair the earbuds as if for the first time and the left earbud still refused to emit any sound.

The Bluetooth connectivity is exceptional, ensuring a seamless pairing process, stable connection, and quick reconnection. The device excels in battery performance, boasting extended life and rapid charging capabilities. However, it falls short for gaming enthusiasts due to noticeable latency issues, impacting the overall gaming experience. Additionally, it's worth noting that the Skullcandy RAIL's do not have in-ear detection. Despite these limitations, the Skullcandy RAIL remains a strong contender for those prioritizing top-notch audio in their daily activities. What makes it even more appealing is that it offers these features at a great value for the money.","Reviewed in the United States March 6, 2024",AF7OR7OPG7TSZ242HTS3UNY6IIHQ,True,0,Color: BlackStyle: Rail

The only con is battery life is shorter than some other brands, but I'll take that for the much better noise cancelling in this price range. Great option for this price range.I tried Anker noise cancelling ear buds, but they really could not compete with these as I had to have volume up almost max for same noise cancelling effect.

The touch controls seem to require a random amount of touch/force to activate each time(sometimes a brush of hair will trigger it, sometimes a full pressed finger won't). The list goes on.Most of this could be excused, or at least justified by the relatively inexpensive price, except I have owned two different pairs of the previous model the Indy ANC and neither of them had these problems.TLDR: Worse product than the previous iteration for the same money.

R3OPHZVX0OPQKG,B0B75RL6JX,5.0 out of 5 stars Surprisingly pretty decent,DG57,5,"Normally my reviews are very short and to the point however this one's going to be a little bit longer. I didn't think that these would actually be worth it but in fact they are. There are extremely many features that are missing on very expensive earbuds. And I'm talking the big brands...First I'll tell you that when you do set up with the app a hearing test it actually does work it helps greatly especially if ones hearing isn't what it used to be. Secondly, as with most, you can set your equalizer to your own personal settings if you want to. The sound, or music, actually doesn't sound awful again I was a bit surprised. Now another thing that is usually a problem for me just keeping my buds in my ears at all times. Well please actually stay in perfectly and they don't hurt one bit and that's using them for at least 9 hours in a row without taking them out. The battery life as far as I know it looks like it might be pretty good unfortunately I haven't given it enough time to judge that but by the usage I have had with the buds they seem to hold up relatively well with ambient on. Basically I'm very satisfied with these I will keep them and hope that they do keep them updated as they should when needed.Now one con is the app is a pain in the butt. It has to always know you're nearby settings it always ask you to have Bluetooth on, which is already on and the buds are already connected before you get into the app. I don't get that one maybe they'll fix it and the other which is unfortunately the case. The case is a bit flimsy and when you want to try to keep the lid open it keeps falling down so I think that that was a architectural design flaw other than that they're definitely worth it I'll get over the case problem all I have to say is if you want them you'll be happy with them.

My previous buds include Bose and Samsung so this is the basis for my comparison. Pairing was uneventful and the Skull IQ app is easy to use. ANC and Stay Aware feature work as advertised. Fit is comfortable and secure. Audio is more than acceptable; especially is you use the Skull IQ app to customize the sound as well as the included hearing test portion of the app to create a personalized profile. For those that suggest there is not enough bass, I recommend using the app to customize the sound and make sure that the buds are tightly fitted. I would buy them again for the price I paid (not sure why but my price was 49.88 new).

R3H10YDL5HCE03,B0B75RL6JX,"1.0 out of 5 stars Allergic reaction, weak app, connectivity issues",Mack,1,"Edit: added more at the endIf you had an allergic reaction to Samsung Buds 2 or their other earbuds, you'll react to these as well. I wore the Rail ANC for less than one afternoon and by dinner my ears were already reacting with liquid discharge. This morning at 4am I had one ear almost totally crusted over and still leaking while the other was leaking but less crusted. I've had this reaction before and I suspect it's the material used for the inserts. Also, the little logo they put on them didn't help either. Anything that causes friction in the ear canal is a stupid idea. I got these for a trip I'm taking on a plane across country and I'm kinda screwed now because I can't return them in time to get something else. My old wired headphones from when I bought my Samsung pgone don't react, so I took those ear inserts and luckily they fit, so I through them on. Once my ears stop reacting and chill out, I'll see if that fixes the issue in time for my trip.As far as function goes, the headphones are okay at best. They can get plenty loud to the point that ANC or their Stay Aware pass through mode mean nothing. It's nice to know I can listen at lower volumes like I prefer and still have ambient noise be mostly audible or have anc keep things subdued. But subdued is the best they give and mostly audible ambient noise is about as much as you can expect. These aren't stellar at either. Doable, but not something I'd laude about.They sound pretty good for what they are. Not sure if I'd say they're $100 headphone quality or value, allergies aside, but they don't sound awful by any means. Music was clear and had some rumble. I used the sound personalization and it was easy enough to get decent sound. There a bass boost, general music and podcast sound setting with a customizable equalizer in the app as well.The buttons on the side are touch activated and finicky. I tend to tap fast and expect fast responses, but these prefer a more methodical pace. The sweetspot for where to touch is also funky, but I started getting it after a few hours. Also, the audio queues are clear enough, but an option to remove them would make things feel faster. Also, if they're not in my ear, I wish touch capacity stopped. Plenty of time I took one out and accidentally started changing tracks, changing volume and activating pairing mode.I remapped all the touch responses and even changed what ear did what. One tap on either paused, double tap on left was volume down, on right it's volume up. Three taps left was previous track and same on the right was skip ahead. Long press in either toggles ANC on/off and pass through audio. I appreciate customization like that.For what stands out as good, I'd say it's the voice prompts. Much quicker to respond than on my phone or watch and that's kinda sad because it's the feature I'll probably never use and cared rhe least about, but seemed so much better than my phones inbuilt assistant that Samsung spent so much time, effort and money on to develop (rip bixby). If you like using voice commands, that's gonna go great, although the ""take photo"" command doesn't work with my Samsung's camera app. Again, not something I was after anyways.One of my favorite features was the built-in tile function for finding them if I lose one or both. The tile app isn't super intuitive, but I mostly figured it out and stumbled my way into it connecting both buds. It creates a tone I can hear when the room in my apartment is silent and has a directional sensor to let me know if I'm getting hotter or colder. Granted, it's not terribly responsive, sensitive or consistent, but if I moved slowly through a room, I bet between the proximity sensor and sound I'd probably find one if I lost one. It's a nice feature to have where I'd otherwise be totally screwed, so I'll take a win where I can with these.I got these on pre-order. When they were scheduled to release after 2 weeks, they ended up coming 10 days earlier or less. It seems weird i had to pre-order when people said they were already at Walmart for a couple weeks, but whatever.I'll update after my ears recover and try them using the non-reactive ear inserts from my old wired heaphones and see if they don't react again. I was furious about my Galaxy Buds 2 causing this reaction, but my wired stuff and my LG Tone Platinums never caused an issue. If it weren't summer and the LG Tone Platinums weren't makeing my neck hot, I might never have bothered looking at this style Bluetooth buds again. But it's a trip to a Nevada training center after the hottest july month on record in human history with averages around 110 in the area I'll be. I thought I'd take a chance on mild comfort. I'm hoping I didn't waste my money now that almost out of time.EDIT: It's been a few days so I'll add more input. Battery is pretty good, but it's not enough to bump a star.The app Skullcandy IQ is awful. It's what controls your key presses. The problem is the app is always on, but loses connection and resets all your programmed key presses. I end up having to reset them every day when they eventually connect poorly. The app logo constantly in my phones notification bar isn't necessary or tell me any input about my headphones. If it at least told me battery levels or connection status, maybe I wouldn't be so annoyed, but this just ISN'T ready for prime time.Also, the ear inserts are what caused the allergic reaction. They jerryrigged replacements I found by chance from a totally different set of wired buds from an old phone work well enough, but I shouldn't have to find my own replacements. At least having an option for different inserts that are non-reactive would be beneficial like memory foam or whatever. Again, Samsung Buds 2 had this EXACT issue and replacing inserts with an aftermarket set was the only solution. For a list of symptoms, it's pretty unmistakable: liquid discharge, discolored mucousal discharge in ear, weeping ear, flaking and scaly skim that seems to build up and shed, pain itching, inflammation, basically a large skin irritation in your ear canal that, if unmanaged, becomes a severe ear infection. Samsung got sued for it and has been paying out for their affected customers. Skullcandy is headed the same way with these unless they have a hypoallergenic replacement in the wing.If the connectivity issue wasn't so bad and not saving my preset remapped button setting wasn't so annoying, perhaps I would add a star or two, but this isn't ready for release and I'm probably returning after giving another day or two. Really sucks I'm screwed out of my trip for headphones, but I'm not gonna struggle with a new set of buds I paid good money for. I'll just go back to wired at this point.","Reviewed in the United States August 6, 2023",AGBD5VMAS2AAPL36TJ7KCLJ6HJNA,True,33,Color: BlackStyle: Rail ANC
R2LT64DQ1X3GZN,B0B75RL6JX,3.0 out of 5 stars Immediate issues,xjarius,3,"I have long been a fan of Skullcandy headphones and earbuds, at least 10 - 15 years. The earbuds were always decent and sturdy, even if you got cheaper ones.My last pair of true wireless earbuds were the Skullcandy Indy earbuds, and I was so sorry to see these were no longer being made.But I was looking forward to the Rail ANC earbuds. First, ANC! Second, a decent IPX4. Third, great battery life. Plus, they cost more, so they must be higher quality, right? So I splurged a little on June 28, 2024. These earbuds sound pretty good. I can tell only a minor difference when the ANC is on and when it's off. The passthrough mode is okay, maybe about as good as the Indy's. The battery life was amazing. That's right. Was. We'll get to that. I loved using the app SkullIQ, where you can customize control settings. I was able to change what the number of taps on the sensor does. Super cool!My list of gripes as of 8/23/2024.First of all, how did my right earbud stop working within the first month? There's a sound when you press the sensor. Within 2 weeks, it started randomly making the sensor pressing sound. Then it started saying Pairing... pairing... as if I was doing long single presses. Then it started skipping to the next track(triple press) and trying to start Spotify* (double press). Within the first month it just wouldn't power on at all. I tried all the tricks and worked with Skullcandy support to no avail. They suggested I submit a warranty claim.*Sidenote: how does it fail to open Spotify whether I'm listening to Spotify or not?).Sometimes they will connect to my phone even thought they are in their case and should be off. My Indy's would do this, too, but it took at least a year or two before that started. This started within the first two months.Every once in a while they wont even connect and you will have to go to settings, forget device, then pair them to your phone again. This is what Skullcandy support had me try to fix the right earbud. Occasionally I need to do this on the left earbud as well. Well if you do this, you have to customize the SkullIQ app again.The case is cheap. My Indy's case was solid and sturdy. It had a few LEDs to indicate how much battery life was left in the case. This new one is flimsy with one light that shows you if the battery is being charged or not.Lastly, the Indy's stayed in my ears much better than the Rail's do. So I'm constantly needing to readjust them in my ears. With a name like Rail, I figured it was made for an active lifestyle. I wash windows for a living, but these things don't stay in my ears too well.As of today, they are in the mail headed to San Diego for the warranty claim. Hopefully, I get a somewhat better product when it's returned.","Reviewed in the United States August 23, 2024",AHV5ROMBVTEEYRVPTVNTHS7P52EA,True,0,Color: BoneStyle: Rail ANC
RQBE8LOFHEMNF,B0B75RL6JX,5.0 out of 5 stars These buds murder AirPods Pro 2,Joshua Busby,5,"Tl;dr - Here‚Äôs what you probably came here to find out:- Sound quality is phenomenal. Deep bass and rich crystal clear highs. Hands down better than AirPods Pro 2, and significantly so imo.- Battery life is the longest I‚Äôve ever experienced, once again shaming Apple.- Noise cancelling is great. For this, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs equal to AirPods Pro 2, if not slightly better.- They fit very snugly in my ears and don‚Äôt fall out with movement. They come with three pairs of ear tips, each a different size.- Very good construction and premium feel. They also look really good.- The charging case can either be charged with a type-C wire, or on any wireless charger by laying them down on the charging pad.- The Skullcandy IQ app is actually useful with features such as custom EQ, voice control configuration, ANC controls, etc.Long version:Borrowed my Wife‚Äôs AirPods Pro 2 off and on for a week before deciding to give these a go as they were 50% off, and as someone who listens to metal and hard rock, these things absolutely murder Apple‚Äôs flagship buds. As far as sound quality and loudness, going from the AirPods Pro 2 to these was like going from ramen noodles to premium ribeye. The bass is right where it should be, and the treble is crystal clear and clean. Loud is an understatement. I use Spotify Premium and am happy with the EQ within that app, but the EQ within the Skullcandy app is really great as well. These are made well and feel great. Battery is roughly 6-7 hours, so really great. They fit great, are very comfortable, and don‚Äôt fall out with movement. All in all, these buds are amazing. Apple can‚Äôt compete.","Reviewed in the United States April 26, 2024",AE6BWRNCJSN5J52HYLXDSZSZT6MQ,True,36,Color: BlackStyle: Rail ANC

R2T1NRXO5997GD,B0B75RL6JX,"2.0 out of 5 stars Unfortunately, not a great purchase‚Ä¶ but I am keeping them.",Kyle H.,2,"I had skull candy headphones as a kid, and loved them. Granted, this is back when headphones still physically plugged into a device or phone. So when I saw these I was super excited. Unfortunately, they ended up being the LEAST enjoyable earbud I have purchased, yet. Before you read further, it is worth noting that a lot of people are super satisfied with these earbuds, so it is extremely likely that this is more about my user preferences not matching with the specs of the item. That being said, the following are the agitations and the positives I‚Äôve experienced since using them:THE CONS:‚Ä¢ The earbuds regularly don‚Äôt sync with my phone & I am prompted at least 3x a week to ‚Äúforget‚Äù the earbuds and then go through the pairing process again. Not a huge problem, but a mild inconvenience made worse by the regularity in which it happens.‚Ä¢ The earbuds fall out of my ears from my jaw moving, which happens often, because my jaw moves when I talk on the phone.‚Ä¢ The earbuds require an app to be downloaded to my phone, in order to customize each button sequence to the desired function (I.e. answer phone, play music, skip forward, etc.). The frustration I have with this is that the earbuds can answer a phone call with a tap, but they cannot end the call with a tap. So, in order to hang up, I have to use my phone screen (or wait for the person I‚Äôm talking with to hang up).‚Ä¢ The earbuds verbalize information about the device, each time you put them in your ear. I can see how some people might prefer this, but I prefer just a simple one or two note ‚Äúchime‚Äù to let me know the earbud is connected to the device. These earbuds state the following, each time I put them in: *chime*‚Ä¶ pause‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúBattery at __%‚Äù‚Ä¶ pause‚Ä¶ ‚Äúconnected‚Äù. This will happen, even if you‚Äôre listening to music or are actively talking on the phone & you swap earbuds. Again, not a huge problem, but a frequent nuisance.THE PROS:Now, despite these gripes, I will say that the sound quality of both phone calls and music are REALLY good (for the price of the earbud). Moreover, I have used AirPods, Beats Pro, and JBL earbuds‚Ä¶ and I have had a few people tell me that the sound quality of my voice for them (when on the phone) is noticeably better. I did not ask these people before hand, they voiced it on their own accord. One person even said ‚Äúdid you get new headphones?! I can hear you so much better now!‚Äù. For these reasons, despite my many personal gripes, I am keeping the headphones. But buyer beware, they are definitely frustrating at times.","Reviewed in the United States August 21, 2024",AFKVKKJVHYVBJLCH466S6QD7JL4A,True,0,Color: BlackStyle: Rail ANC

Overall, when it comes to the sound, it knocks it out of the ballpark.Though, one of my only gripes with it is the fit. It wasn‚Äôt built for movement.

I own a set of Grind and Push Active, currently, and the case for the Push stopped charging, which is why I am here.I had really high hopes for these and was really let down. I purchased a set (XT) from Walmart and they sounded terrible. I returned them and saw these on sale and got them, thinking they might be different. The Walmart set was tagged with the 'XT' qualifier, so I didn't know if there were different components used in them.There aren't.1. I feel like I have average sized hands for a dude, so I don't know why I seem to fumble with getting the buds out and into the case. And when I say fumble, I'm talking about the kind of fumble that causes them to fall down a storm drain 10 feet away. I have had to hunt them down because they shot across the room when getting them out. I don't do that with my other sets. I feel like its my technique, but I dont know what the right one is...2. Touch Sensitivity is off the charts. I cannot turn up the volume, turn on ANC or anything else without accidentally pausing what I am listening to, EVERY SINGLE TIME. If you want to take one out to talk to someone, don't hold it in your hand. Now my boss knows I listen to Hailee Steinfeld, and SkullCandy is to blame. 100%. Thanks... I stopped using this feature, I lost patience and went back to doing everything on my phone. This may be a ""give it time"" thing or maybe making pause/play three taps is the answer.3. The sound. It's kinda bad... especially when you get up in volume. Even at about 75% I can hear distortion and they're no louder than my other sets at 75%. This is why I returned the XT to Walmart, because of this distortion. I do not have this issue with the Grind or Push Active, even at 100%.I don't know what happened.The positives:1. The announcement is toned down and less obtrusive. So if someone calls and I want to put them in, I dont have to pause my convo for 45 seconds. I can hear over it enough now to understand what's being said.2. The bass on them is really f'in nice, which is what I wanted when I bought these. I think this is the trade-off with distortion though, which is a major bummer. I will say that when these things get rockin with a nice bass track that doesn't distort, they can wiggle themselves right out of your ear. All you have to do is push them back in...pause...","Reviewed in the United States June 19, 2024",AGMO6CYINLL4ZTWZS7VP5Z3AB5VQ,True,0,Color: BlackStyle: Rail ANC

Up until today (3/5/2024), when this review is being written, ownership has been fantastic. The Rail ANC earbuds performed effortlessly and are light-years ahead of my previous earbuds from Gravastar. However, one earbud, the left specifically, has ceased to emit any sound. Its touch and ANC features still operate, but there is zero sound emitted through the speaker. This is the first time an earbud or similar device has done this in my experience, and while I know nothing is perfect forever, but I am wondering how it happened. I have my volume set to its lowest setting and do not drop, abuse, or otherwise mistreat the device. When not in use, both earbuds are stored in the charging case. I should also add that I did attempt to pair the earbuds as if for the first time and the left earbud still refused to emit any sound. A disappointment to an otherwise fantastic product.","Reviewed in the United States March 5, 2024",AECWLJLCPVHBKGMPQAO4HXIXPP5Q,True,1,Color: BlackStyle: Rail ANC

The battery use life between recharging seems kind of short. From fully charged to 30% in about 3 hours. The case recharges them quite fast. However, they fall out, no matter which pieces are used. Maybe it's the shape of my ear canal. But with the effort required to keep pushing them back in and the placement of the ""buttons"" on the piece, I end up disconnecting calls on the regular. If don't keep pushing them back in, they will fall out and then I'm scrambling on the zoom call to find the errant earbud that is now under my desk.

So just touching the dumb earbuds pauses the audio or goes into this annoying voice announcer about switching into some kind of Spotify mode or something.It ends up being like you're dealing with a annoying misbehaved kid while you're trying to enjoy any peace time.

Sound quality seems fine, but that's about it. MANY connection issues including; The earbuds not pairing correctly sometimes, The earbuds will not disconnect or shut off when put in the pod, if the pod is not charged. The touch controls seem to require a random amount of touch/force to activate each time(sometimes a brush of hair will trigger it, sometimes a full pressed finger won't). The list goes on.Most of this could be excused, or at least justified by the relatively inexpensive price, except I have owned two different pairs of the previous model the Indy ANC and neither of them had these problems.TLDR: Worse product than the previous iteration for the same money.

The active noise canceling works surprisingly well for in ear buds. Just the ANC alone with no audio will significantly reduce background noise. There is also an option for ambient noise to be played which i like to use when reading or sleeping.If you have the ANC on & are playing music you will not hear any background noise short of a jackhammer next to your ears.As to be expected from in ear buds, but still worth mentioning, there is virtually zero noise leak from these. People around you will not be able to hear what you're playing even if it's loud.I bought these mainly to use at the gym. One of my main concerns was that these would fall out easily while I'm workout out or running, as I've had that issue with other ear buds. I have not had that issue at all, these fit very securely in the ear and do not fall out easily at all, while still being very comfortable. There is a little ridge that will slide into the groove above your ear canal that makes them very secure.Battery life is great and they charge quickly. They come with a C-to-C charging cord that will charge the case very rapidly.My only minor complaint is that they don't go quite as loud as I would like them to, but I'm someone who always listens to my music very loudly. They are by no means quiet earbuds and this should only dissuade you if you're someone looking for earbuds capable of going extremely loud.Really for this price they are fantastic.

It works so seamlessly with the phone it feels like an expansion pack or something. Answering calls is easy and has incredible mic quality. Not sure how.

I'm absolutely blown away by how good these sound. I didn't think it was possible to get such huge sound out of earbuds. These lil things are the size of a roided out bean and they absolutely dominate my entire skull. Most people are going to be like ""Yo the bass is fire. Riz and bruh and other sounds,"" but it's so much more than that. They deliver rich and clean audio across all frequencies. Yes, bass included. Very very f****** included.

R2NGKUBNRM0FD6,B0CF7GYNW2,4.0 out of 5 stars Good buds!,David D,4,"I recently purchased the SAMSUNG Galaxy Buds FE True Wireless Bluetooth Earbuds in the Graphite color and I have been extremely impressed with their performance. As someone who is always on the go and constantly listening to music or podcasts, having a reliable and comfortable pair of earbuds is essential for me. The Galaxy Buds FE have exceeded my expectations in both of these areas.First and foremost, the comfort and secure fit of these earbuds is top-notch. The wing-tip design ensures that they stay in place even during intense workouts or when I'm running errands. I have tried many other wireless earbuds in the past and have always struggled with finding a pair that stays in my ears comfortably. The Galaxy Buds FE have solved this problem for me and I can wear them for hours without any discomfort.The sound quality of these earbuds is also impressive. The audio is clear and crisp, with a good balance of bass and treble. I have used them for both music and phone calls and have been pleased with the sound in both scenarios. The touch controls on the earbuds are also very convenient and easy to use. I can easily pause or skip a song without having to take out my phone.One of the standout features of these earbuds is the auto switch audio. This allows me to seamlessly switch between my phone and laptop when I receive a call or want to listen to something on my computer. It's a small feature, but it has made a big difference in my daily routine.I also appreciate the built-in voice assistant feature. I can easily access my virtual assistant with just a touch of the earbud, making it convenient to make calls, send texts, or get directions without having to take out my phone.The battery life on these earbuds is also impressive. I can use them for several hours without needing to recharge, and the charging case provides additional battery life when I'm on the go. The case is also compact and easy to carry around.Overall, I highly recommend the SAMSUNG Galaxy Buds FE True Wireless Bluetooth Earbuds. They offer a comfortable and secure fit, great sound quality, and convenient features that make them a must-have for anyone looking for a reliable pair of wireless earbuds. Whether you're a music lover, fitness enthusiast, or just someone who wants a hassle-free listening experience, these earbuds are definitely worth considering.The only drawback is that the case is not wireless charging.

R3FSH2ISQZ07D8,B0CF7GYNW2,5.0 out of 5 stars The Perfect Storm!!! Flawless execution of what SHOULD BE,TheChrisSimon,5,"2 years ago I was I acquired a pair of the Galaxy Buds+. I would have never I have purchased them myself, as spending top dollar for a pair of earbuds or headphones to me was not something that I would have spit my money on. I had no instructions, just a little black case in the bottom of a drawer, that someone had left behind. What I discovered, was a piece of technology, that made my life better, and it's quality, simplicity, and joy that it bestowed upon my soul.I only had that unit for a period of maybe 2 months. During that time I use them to live. The full sound l, flawless amplification of surrounding noises, everything about these was amazing. The fit in my ear, the simplicity of touch controls, everything made them something I didn't know that I couldn't live without. Through sheer negligence, I I dropped the right bud into a toilet, and flust it before I realized what had happened. There was a period of grief. And that left bud sat in its case and a drawer for 4 months, as I did not have the disposable funds to go buy a new pair, until it occurred to me to just buy a replacement for the lost bud. Purchase of the second hand market I could never get it to pair and it just sent me further into sadness.Set that time I have made an emission, define a worthy replacement. I have spent conservatively $1,800 and tried every brand from generic to Apple to the Samsung's themselves come and nothing matched the pure perfection of the plus. Well what are you going to do they don't make them anymore. And then on prime I saw that Samsung was selling them, for more then they're top of the line current model. How's this possible? They quit selling them years ago?My theory is that the human ear, Is only so big. There was a team at Samsung that put this bud into the Universe, and those in the upper echelon know it is the Alpha qnd Omaga. I planned up the lessons, and the perfect bargain earbud does not make for the quarterly Prophets jump where the marketing team happy. So they have hidden this, for those that are only in the know. Hey now you know, I bought and Amazon refurbished pair, as well as the buds FE. As a birthday present. The buds FE arrived 3 days before the plus, and I did not unseal the package, because I knew in my heart. I went to my Amazon locker 3 days later with speed and haste that not felts in years. Went home and let them sit for a good I don't know hour and a half as I twittered about my apartment. And when I put them in my ear? Yeah, that's the stuff. Look no further. I mean wait I don't want you to take them all, keep your secret between us. Don't tell anybody about me, we will be the ones the know.","Reviewed in the United States July 20, 2024",AHDU55ERJSNNE2TRRY3IES4KN6VA,True,24,Color: GraphiteStyle: Buds FE Only

First you get a white charging case with black headphones inside. There is NO other option, its how all Galaxy Buds FE come. That's silly, and shows just how badly Samsung is trying to penny pinch. I purchased them in black because both my Samsung phones, watch and other accessories are in black. If I had wanted white, then I would have bought the white earbuds!Secondly, unlike the other Galaxy Bud models currently. there is no wireless charging available. While that's not a major issue for me, it would sometimes be convenient to just be able to set the whole case down on my Samsung trio wireless charging stand. Instead I have to set them off to the side and attach the USB-C cable to the back.

The rubberized winged edge on each earbud hooks right into your ear without being uncomfortable over 4+ hours of use.Case Quality: 8/10The reason I needed to buy a pair of wireless earbuds is because the case for my last pair came apart at the hinge after a few drops. I‚Äôm not always easy on these things, they get tossed into backpacks and I‚Äôm bound to drop them here and there. The case for these feels pretty sturdy and secure. They‚Äôre a hard, glossy plastic and there‚Äôs a mechanism in place holding the lid up when fully open, which is satisfying. I don‚Äôt like how easily I can bend the lid backward as it seems to have quite a bit of give to it, but when closed it feels firmly clasped shut, so hopefully that‚Äôs never something I need to worry about.Battery Life: 7/10I get a solid 5+ hours of listening time out of these with noise cancelling on, and 3+ charges out of the case. They‚Äôre not going to blow your mind, but they hold their own just fine.Noise Cancelling: 8/10Really surprised at how well these block out noise for a pair of earbuds that cost less than $100. Cutting grass or walking near noisy roads won‚Äôt be an issue.I want acknowledge a big reason you may not want to buy these. If you‚Äôre an iPhone user, there is no app available to adjust EQ or add the functionality to skip or reverse - only pause, play, and noise cancelling controls as a default will be available to you. If you have a windows laptop or could use somebody else‚Äôs Android device for a few minutes, you can enable the ability to skip and reverse and play around with some other features. I myself use iPhone but don‚Äôt mind lack of app support because my fiancee has an Android, and once you set them up you‚Äôre not likely to need the app very often, if at all.","Reviewed in the United States August 8, 2024",AHH37BTDBFCWAKSMQFKWHKP2V6WQ,True,4,Color: GraphiteStyle: Buds FE Only

But overall I like them alot.","Reviewed in the United States August 1, 2024",AFVZMGKEZORD5EWHLHT537N4J7QQ,True,1,Color: GraphiteStyle: Buds FE Only

If you have questions about these topics please read!I purchased these for my boyfriend. He has a Samsung S22. I have bought him multiple types of brand new earbuds in the $70-$80 range in the past. He had to charge all those daily in order to used for 1.5 hrs while he walked. I wanted to buy him something nicer so I bought these. I chose to buy a used set in hopes that they were in great condition and maybe the box was just torn. I changed them overnight on accident (I prefer not to charge too long). Then paired then with my iPhone. I have owned several versions and pairs of iPods and Beats Pro (over the ear). So my first reaction was disappointment because the sound quality did not compare and little things didn‚Äôt work the same. For example when you take your Beats out if your ear whatever your watching stops. That is not the case with these. Also when a call comes in, I had to manually change the option to the ear bud on my phone screen vs just answering by touching my ear. However, I still gave them to my boyfriend for Easter and when he paired them with his galaxy he was prompted to add an extra app that gave him different features than I had with my Apple. Initially he was not too impressed with the sound, he expected them to be louder. The noise canceling was so good, he had to take them out to hear me talk to him. What he loved about them was the length of time he was able to go before charging the case. Remember I charged them one time, then he used them off of my original charge after sitting in the box for a few days. He wore them everyday for 5 days without charging the case. At that point he was really happy with them. Enough to overlook the sound quality since it was not what he expected. Unfortunately when he charged the case he was not able to get the Right earbud to charge. We tried different troubleshooting methods. Unfortunately none of them have worked. We will be sending them back. I don‚Äôt have experience using Apple headphones or buds with Samsung phones but I feel if I had bought these brand new, he would keep them vs buying headphones like mine. I‚Äôd rather pay an extra $50 to get new products going forward. Please air on the side of caution if you buy used or refurbished version of these ear buds. Hopefully this helps someone trying to decide between new or used and Apple/Beats products vs Other earbuds to pair with an android phone.","Reviewed in the United States April 11, 2024",AGJMX2SCRHKROIKHLJLZZB64452A,True,2,Color: GraphiteStyle: Buds FE Only

R3QAMJKDDU4VAK,B0CF7GYNW2,4.0 out of 5 stars Jury is still out,ShaunMar,4,"Jury is still out on these. I think if my phone didn't have Samsung Sound Assistant to eq the sound, it would fall short of expectations.Surprisingly, these sound louder & more bold on my iPhone. Back on the Galaxy, the bass is less pronounced than my old buds live. You could argue that's a more 'balanced' sound, but if you want more bass, you want more bass.They do seem to stay in ear better than the live & the BT signal connection is much improved over the live. The live was straight garbage when it came to holding on to the BT signal.One thing I dislike is no good way way of seeing battery levels.Other features are cool. May update this review later after I've had it for longer. One thing is I wouldn't pay a dime more than I did for it. It would be a better value at a lower price.","Reviewed in the United States May 6, 2024",AGU3XLILM3YJZCHEXXZ7DUJUQNEA,True,2,Color: GraphiteStyle: Buds FE Only

R1BQJ9X35VH5PQ,B0CF7GYNW2,5.0 out of 5 stars These earbuds are pretty much perfect,vacuums,5,"I had a pair of Galaxy Buds from years ago that I really like but were starting to act up. I looked at a lot of different options and even tried a set of Anker buds that I ended up returning. I came back to these, which I think are the newer version of what I had. Things I like:-The buttons are very easy to tap and double or triple tap. There are a lot of different options to customize what that does in the app.-Sound quality is great.-The fit is fantastic for me. I love the ear ""wings"". They make a nice secure fit that and it never feels like they are in danger of falling out.-Changing case is compact and these charge easily by dropping them in.-There is an option to set either the right or left earbud to toggle between noise canceling and ambient sound modes when you long press. Both these modes work great. Noise canceling is enough that I can mow the lawn without needing separate ear protection and I can quickly switch to ambient mode if I need to hear someone talking to me.-The biggest upside is that these are quite a bargain. Quite a bit less than some of Samsung's other models of earbuds.","Reviewed in the United States May 26, 2024",AHBS6XL3547LMXGA6C7OAOHBKJYQ,True,2,Color: WhiteStyle: Buds FE Only
R3IBHZG8O0BRYE,B0CF7GYNW2,4.0 out of 5 stars Best earbuds I have ever used,Carolina De La Ossa,4,"I purchased this earbuds because I was tired of using some cheap SkullCandy ones that really hurt my ears. These are the most confortable buds I've ever used, specially for me since I have tiny ears. I also love the fact that they stay in place when using them for workouts and jogging sessions. The noise cancellation works wonders. I'm not particularly fan of the ambient noise feature, it amplifies the ambient noise to much, even when setting that to ""low"". If I take these to the office, I end up accidentally eavesdropping what my coworkers are talking about from a mile away, which ends up been distracting. The idea was to notice if someone was talking to me so I didn't have to continuously take the buds off. Also, Mac support isn't the best, but I'm sure that's Apple's fault haha.","Reviewed in the United States May 11, 2024",AFLT22IXIXZMRWEOQJT2VHKS4TJQ,True,2,Color: GraphiteStyle: Buds FE Only

R2J5F63E48VZCU,B0CF7GYNW2,3.0 out of 5 stars Not overly impressed,Amazon Cutstomer,3,"I've only had these a day but there are not many reviews so I'll give my 1st impressions. I wore them for a few hours doing yard work (using my Samsung S22) and tried them with some of my favorite test tracks connected to my PC and using Amazon HD music (using Exclusive mode)The first thing that surprised me was the white case... I ordered black, and at first thought they sent the wrong ones but opened the case and the buds themselves were black. I don't like white, but whatever.Looking at the case there is not much indication of what is the front and it's a bit fiddly to open. The magnet to suck the buds into place is not very strong, so a bit fiddly to lay them in the case.I don't like wearing buds much, but these were pretty comfortable right out of the box. The insertion was not quite as deep as I like but they stayed in well while I was moving around and I did not feel the need to keep adjusting them.How do they sound:I want to emphasize these are first impressions.These have a polite sound that would probably please many people. I'm not one of them. When I got the Lypertek buds for the same price I told people ""I can't believe how good a sound you can get for $100 these days"". With these, I would say ""They are ok, most people would like them"".They are ""fine"" for having something playing in your ear while you do something else but they did not bring out any joy in the music for me. Nothing stood out about the sound. Ordinary comes to mind or, nothing wrong but nothing right. I'm not into 'soundstage' the the lack of one while listening to live tracks actually stood out to me.The sound is a bit congested, the instruments kind of bunched into each other. There is no 'air' around the instruments. I found myself pushing the volume louder than I normally listen to ""wake them up a bit"".Detail retrieval is decent, but you are not going to notice the reverb, the grind of a distorted guitar, the 'ting' of the drumsticks on a cymbal, breath sounds, etc. The overall presentation is smooth enough from low to high, with no glaring holes, or peaks. If I had to fault the frequency response it would be male voices. Just a bit in your face at times. Bass get a bit tubby if you try to push it much. In ""normal"" mode I found it just about right.Let's see what I can 'fix' with EQ. The EQ in the App has 9 bands, cool! But that hardly matters if there is no custom EQ option. Seriously Samsung? The Sennheiser App only has 3 bands but at least they let you set a custom EQ, name it, and save it.There are 7 presets, but none of them really gave me something I liked. But there is enough variety that most people would find something they like.I'm mixed on keeping them. The sound is good enough for what I want them for. listening to music while I do something else. They are comfortable and stay in well, but I am not impressed with the sound. It's ""fine"", it's ""okay"", and ""good enough"" but not impressed with the sound for the $100 price point.","Reviewed in the United States October 21, 2023",AHEC6HVESDBP2W2DMMSYGA4GPGFA,True,43,Color: GraphiteStyle: Buds FE Only

RUUJJA0TERA67,B096SV8SJG,5.0 out of 5 stars Compared to 4 other Earbuds...,Connor,5,"I bought these earbuds along with 4 other pairs, with the intent of comparing them over a couple weeks and returning all but my favorite. Here were the results:Beats Fit Pro - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JL65GNM?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros ‚Äì These buds had some great base, and the wingtip gave them a fit that made them refuse to fall out of my ears. But the best feature? Physical ‚Äúclicky‚Äù buttons on each one of the buds. You press in and hear/feel the click, rather than relying on a touchscreen-like feature. No need to guess if you tapped them once or twice, you will know.Cons ‚Äì The wingtip gives a very sturdy fit, but not the most comfortable. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend to anyone with smaller ears. The noise canceling was solid, but nothing special. And this may be picky, but I didn‚Äôt care for most of the color schemes available. I prefer my earbuds to be hard to notice, and even the black ones have a bright red letter ‚Äúb‚Äù in the middle.Beats Studio Buds - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B096SV8SJG?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros ‚Äì Very comfortable with the same great physically ‚Äúclicky‚Äù buttons as the Beats Fit Pro. Noise canceling seemed slightly better than average. Great base. Classic look.Cons ‚Äì Tested during a workout, a little bit of sweat had these sliding right out of my ear. The case for these earbuds also was the flimsiest of any I had tested, with a very weak hinge that I was scared of breaking off within the 2 weeks of using.Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08MWZHHKP?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros ‚Äì A neat feature that I noticed only in these earbuds was that it had noise amplification as well as noise cancelation. With one swipe in the app, the surrounding sound was actually louder and clearer than it would be without the earbuds in. Great if you are hard of hearing, or just enjoy snooping on conversations out of reach.Cons ‚Äì Similar to the Beats Studio Buds, these didn‚Äôt stay in during a workout. They were usable, but every 10 minutes I found myself pushing them back into my ear. And this is an opinion, but these are the ugliest earbuds out of the bunch. The shiny black gleam made it look like a large beetle was hanging out in my ear. No visible brand placement either, which makes them appear cheap and generic rather than the quality Samsung they are.Samsung Galaxy Buds Live - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09TBM1L3S?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros ‚Äì Cost effective! I added these to the test group because of the unique shape, and for that they are worth giving a try. If you have small ears and do not like the rubber insert that is standard in most other earbuds, these may be perfect for you.Cons ‚Äì Poor fit for large ears. These were tested the least of all of the buds, because the fit was so bad for my ear shape that they wouldn‚Äôt stay in if I turned my head too fast.Bose QuietComfort - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08C4KWM9T?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros ‚Äì Bose noise canceling is unmatched. If your primary use for earbuds is to cancel out that background white noise, this is the pair for you. The sound quality is great, not too heavy on the base. The case for the earbuds stood out from the rest as the only one that impressed me. Felt very study, and I had no worries tossing it into a gym bag or cup holder. The only case with a button latch to make sure it doesn‚Äôt open accidentally.Cons ‚Äì This was the most expensive pair of earbuds by a longshot, and there were still some things I felt could be improved. The rubber inserts had more of a ‚Äúflayed‚Äù shape rather than the ‚Äúrounded‚Äù shape that is standard. My guess is that this was by design, because the earbuds were also slightly heavier than others and may need that extra in-ear grip. The flayed shape did make them sturdier, but at the cost of them being uncomfortable in an active situation. They were also the largest earbuds, and stuck out from the side of my head further than I would have liked.My favorite? The beats fit pro! While I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this pair for everyone, it was perfect for my routine. My music taste benefits from the boosted base, and the wingtip shape was perfect for any workouts. The feature that really convinced me was the physical buttons, something that I didn‚Äôt realize how desperately I needed.","Reviewed in the United States August 11, 2022",AFEITP6Y25NKH3KB2LXWQCC7STIA,True,2322,Color: BlackStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+
R3EO2GBST2UICI,B096SV8SJG,5.0 out of 5 stars Initial review and comparison to other brands,philip seitz,5,"I love these earbuds. They feel definitely worth the price and a all around great buy. Giving me exactly what I was looking for.For years I have used the raycon E55 and some of the features I loved about raycon was the manual button in the earbuds, excessive bass and great inside-ear fit.Recently however, raycon has gone the way of the world‚Äî they have put sensors on the earbuds in the place of buttons and Balanced out the audio. So I began my search for new earbuds.‚ÄîTHE SOUND‚ÄîBoth the AirPods, galaxybuds and raycons I have tried tend to be balanced and prioritize giving equal notes to all instruments For a clear and concise sound, But to someone who is not an audiophile it sounds very flat and devoid of the punch that I desire. For me- I want it to be great sounding but also noticeably bass heavy. These Beats Studio buds deliver. The company recognizes that your not using these to analyze a song. These are for the people who like bass and want to feel some gravitas in their ears!‚ÄîCONNECTIVITY‚ÄîThese connect effortlessly to iPhone, as if they were AirPods. It was the single biggest factor that blew me away with these. They are incredibly easy to connect. I cannot speak for android but these work great. They do not have a lot of audio adjustments like Bose but I frankly don‚Äôt need them to. You can easily see the battery state on both buds and the case from a pop up window in your apple home screen whenever opening the case, just like AirPods.‚ÄîFIT‚ÄîThe fit is not as good as the raycon E55 but only by a little bit. They fit snuggly in your ears well enough that they do not fall off when running and working out. Although adjustments might need to be made to them occasionally.

R2D114QWXW4IOU,B096SV8SJG,5.0 out of 5 stars I think they‚Äôre great,Maizy,5,"I like the sound a lot. I read a previous review from someone saying that the audio sounds really quiet at first and to fix it go into the setting for your headphones and change the press and hold feature to change the volume, after you use the headphones to turn the volume up, you can switch that setting off back to noise control. After i did that the audio was great, nice and loud. The buds fit nice for me with the small ear tips, not uncomfortable. The case is pretty light as well which i personally like a lot. Pretty solid headphones, I quite like them. The noise cancellation doesn‚Äôt entirely work, but i dont really mind too much since it still blocks out some noise just not entirely.Solid headphones, worth it :)","Reviewed in the United States July 27, 2024",AFRVRGYJJSBAELQK6XVCXXBCJXLA,True,10,Color: BlackStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+
R29LYUZ7DI2CS6,B096SV8SJG,"4.0 out of 5 stars Quality sound and build, BUT...",Everest,4,"After using these for a couple weeks straight, I think it's time to review.I would like to state upfront that I bought these on sale for $75. I bought the black ones because the pink ones weren't on sale.Let's start with some pros:The sound is very good, just about on par with my IEMs. These are definitely catered towards more bassy genres, but in the case of metal, I like being able to hear bass along side lead, and provides some heavy kicks. The physical button instead of just touch is an odd choice, but it works. The package comes with a free trial of Apple music (which I will never use), as well as a tiny usb-c to usb-c charger (so hopefully you have a spare usb-c block), and 3 different sized tips, small, meduim, and large. These have awareness mode, as well as a noise isolation mode. Awareness mode is nice, but noise isolation causes me to have a headache.Now some cons:This may be just my ears, but the small tip is too small, and the medium is just big enough to still be pushed out. The body is very smooth, and if you're someone that produces a lot of earwax (like me), it won't stay put and the only thing keeping it in is the tips, meaning you have to keep pushing them back in, and bumping the button. These sit in a very specific position, but don't really like to stay there. Because of the sound mostly being catered towards bass, some leads and vocals can sound a bit muddy at times. By default, the case doesn't have a loop for a string to hold on to and the case is very smooth, so you have to buy a third party case and put it over the stock case just to make it easier to hold on to. These come with an app, and it's very lackluster. No equalizer, there's a find earbuds feature but I'm pretty sure it's not GPS, and you can't mess with settings if the earbuds aren't connected, not to mention: why do my earbuds need to update?!In conclusion: these are good earbuds and I recommend them, but ONLY IF THEY'RE ON SALE.These are 100% worth the $75 I spent on them, but NO WAY ARE THEY WORTH THE $150 RETAIL PRICE TAG.","Reviewed in the United States August 3, 2024",AEDBORE5CT34E6D7QVXFZW5ZERCA,True,29,Color: BlackStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+

R3OTWPP01KM2BY,B096SV8SJG,3.0 out of 5 stars actually disappointing,kimmy,3,"bought these after my airpod pros died on me suddenly. i have been using these beats studio buds for about 6 months and the experience has been inconsistent to say the least. first issue: they fall out of my ears if i do simple things like turn my head or chew. i can barely walk or exercise with them in because they just fall out. i looked online and it seems others have had these issues; people were suggesting swapping the size of the actual ear bud and even wearing them in reverse (with the left bud in the right ear and right bud in left ear). neither if these worked for me. really made me appreciate the airpod design.it was fairly easy to connect the very first time but every time after that is almost always a pain. if the case is dead but the beats themselves are still charged it‚Äôs like it doesn't recognize that the beats are still working and refuses to connect. even if the case is charged sometimes it just will not recognize that the beats are in range of my phone, even if they're sitting right on top of each other. if it‚Äôs not straight up refusing to connect it‚Äôs disconnecting randomly. if i open my car door - even with the car turned off - the beats automatically disconnect from my phone as if it expects me to connect my phone to carplay. there are many times i have been talking on the phone using my beats and suddenly they will disconnect.the controls only kind of work. you can use the default preset controls like pressing twice for skipping songs and once for hanging up calls and the like. however you're supposed to be able to customize these controls to in your phone settings but they only work as long as the beats are disconnected. as soon as you put the beats away and disconnect everything goes back to default settings the next time you reconnect. noise cancellation is a joke, it sounds the same as when its on transparent mode or off.the case feels like cheap plastic. i got a silicone case because i was afraid of scratching it up. not much else to say about it.the color of the beats are great. i got red and it looks super cool. i think the sound quality is on par with my old airpod pros. when i am on the phone others have not had a problem with not hearing me or me coming across muffled, so that‚Äôs a plus.overall, these earbuds are nothing special. i got these around the holidays when they were almost half off. glad i didn‚Äôt pay full price for these as they are disappointing at best.ETA: as of july 2024 i ditched these and bought another pair of airpod pros. literally no regrets.","Reviewed in the United States May 25, 2024",AFSUYJ3N2JAFCBPFF7G6VM5LLT5A,True,74,Color: RedStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+
R2Y0THHR6HEBSX,B096SV8SJG,5.0 out of 5 stars Gets it done,uhgar,5,"The Beats Studio Buds are true wireless noise-cancelling earbuds that cater to a broad audience, including both Apple and Android users. Here's an unbiased review based on their design, sound quality, features, and value.Design and Comfort:The Beats Studio Buds have a compact and sleek design that makes them visually appealing and easy to carry. They come with three sizes of ear tips, allowing users to find a comfortable and secure fit. The earbuds are lightweight, which contributes to long-lasting comfort, making them suitable for extended use, whether for commuting, working out, or listening to music at home.Sound Quality:The sound profile of the Beats Studio Buds is bass-heavy, which is characteristic of Beats products. This makes them well-suited for genres like hip-hop, pop, and electronic music. However, some users may find that the emphasis on bass comes at the expense of mid-range clarity and treble detail. For audiophiles or those who prefer a more balanced sound, this might be a downside. Overall, the sound is energetic and immersive, which will appeal to many listeners, especially those who enjoy bass-forward audio.Noise Cancellation and Transparency Mode:The active noise cancellation (ANC) feature in the Beats Studio Buds is effective at reducing ambient noise, particularly low-frequency sounds like the hum of an airplane or office chatter. While the ANC is good for the price, it may not be as strong as that found in higher-end models like the AirPods Pro or Sony WF-1000XM4. The transparency mode, which allows ambient sound to filter through, works well for staying aware of your surroundings, making it a practical feature for outdoor use.Battery Life:The battery life of the Beats Studio Buds is decent, offering up to 5 hours of playback with ANC on (8 hours with ANC off), and up to 15 additional hours from the charging case. While this is sufficient for most daily uses, some competing models offer longer battery life. The case itself is compact and easy to pocket, though it lacks wireless charging, which might be a downside for some users.Connectivity and Features:One of the standout features of the Beats Studio Buds is their compatibility with both Apple and Android devices, providing a seamless experience across both platforms. They support one-touch pairing, have a built-in voice assistant, and offer IPX4 water resistance, making them sweat and splash-proof. However, they lack some advanced features found in other earbuds, such as in-ear detection and customizable EQ settings.Value for Money:The Beats Studio Buds are priced competitively, offering good value for those looking for true wireless earbuds with active noise cancellation. They are a great option for users who prioritize style, brand recognition, and bass-heavy sound. However, if you‚Äôre looking for the absolute best ANC or the most balanced sound profile, there are other options in the market that might better suit your needs.Conclusion:The Beats Studio Buds are a solid choice for those who enjoy bass-centric audio and need a reliable pair of true wireless earbuds with noise cancellation. They are particularly appealing to users who value design and brand, as well as those who want a product that works well across both Apple and Android ecosystems. While they may not have all the bells and whistles of higher-end models, they offer a good balance of performance and price, making them a worthy contender in the mid-range earbud market.","Reviewed in the United States August 24, 2024",AG6LHXKCI7OD5ANROGE4RBXEKWNA,True,1,Color: Moon GrayStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+
R2MOD3AIAL0RCQ,B096SV8SJG,"4.0 out of 5 stars Pretty good. Not GREAT, but not bad.",Papa Boots,4,"Whenever I see something with a 4-star review, it usually means it‚Äôs a solid product but there‚Äôs something (or somethings) keeping it out of 5-star range.For me, these are a perfect example of that. They‚Äôre small (good), not terribly obtrusive (only some out-of-ear-stick-out, tho your experience may vary), the sound has some solid bass which is helpful for the gym (where I tested these out), the sound overall is clear (download some equalizer apps to play with the sound itself), and they stayed in my ear well. I don‚Äôt know much about soundstage or whatever, but the sound itself is clear, bass is nice and strong, and you can hear even the subtle nuances like the shifting of a hand on guitar strings clearly enough without being disturbed. That, to me, is the sign of a good earbud.The transparency mode and noise canceling modes were alright. But that‚Äôs just it, they‚Äôre alright. Granted, the AirPod Pros have a higher price tag, so they do the ANC and Transparency mode much better. So it‚Äôs understandable that these would do the same, but on just the slightest bit of a lower level.I‚Äôm also spoiled bc the Airpod Pros have wireless charging. These DO have USB C, but the lack of wireless charging is a small thing, really. There‚Äôs something about being able to toss these on a charging pad and leaving them there to charge that‚Äôs just so satisfying. Also, was not a fan of how the case just doesn‚Äôt have that ‚Äúpremium‚Äù feel. The matte finish is nice, tho I would have liked a little more weight in the case lid, but at this point, these are such little (and I mean LITTLE) things that really, it‚Äôs not a dealbreaker.My only thing is the amount they stick out. I‚Äôm sorry, but they do look a little‚Ä¶funny, the way they sort of stick out just a bit so that the ‚Äúb‚Äù logo is upright. They don‚Äôt stick out a LOT, but juuuuust enough that when you look in the mirror, you‚Äôll see a vertical line where the physical button (which I have managed to press on accident a couple of times while adjusting the bud) sticks out. Also, I had a little difficulty getting them to stay in, but that‚Äôs beyond pretty much anyone‚Äôs control.These get that 4th star because of just how they are a solid enough product worth the purchase. They don‚Äôt do any one thing particularly well, but there are just enough teeny things for me that I wouldn‚Äôt say these are the best I‚Äôve ever used. (For comparison, the Jabra 75t gets the equivalent of a 4.3 rating‚Ä¶the hear-through is amazing and their app really helps boost functionality).For me, these are SOLID gym earbuds. They play music loudly, clearly enough, and the bass is strong enough for me that I can drown out whatever annoying other music is playing outside. They fit and stay relatively well. For the price tag, you get some good bang for the buck. You could do worse, but at this range, depending on if you want to pitch in a few more, you could also do better.","Reviewed in the United States June 27, 2021",AECTDFXXCI5RLPDMMXH2ELH4LJVA,True,1696,Color: RedStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+
R17Q87EWZD6NM0,B096SV8SJG,4.0 out of 5 stars Great sound quality; avoid calls in noisy situations and high wind,Wrex,4,"The Beats Studio Buds have great sound quality and a damn good battery life. However, if you use the Buds in Transparency mode (as I often do at work), you might only get about three to four hours out of each bud. The workaround is that you can easily switch buds with no loss of connection, put the dead one back in the case, and by the time the other one is dead the first is ready to go again.One super important thing to note is that phone calls have absolutely no background noise cancellation whatsoever. The people you are talking to can hear things as small as keyboard clicking. Which can pose a problem if you regularly take calls in high-noise environments. A second flaw is that ANC and Transparency modes do not effectively cancel out high wind noise. A great example of this is riding a motorcycle or even a bicycle - the moment you put the Buds in either mode, all you hear is wind. Plus, if you are on a phone call in a windy environment, the other party has a difficult time hearing you. Even car A/C messes with them.I've dropped the Buds dozens of times on accident and they haven't even so much as scratched. The build quality is impressive. Pairing was super easy with my Pixel 8 Pro - I just opened the case, and it automatically popped up, despite this essentially being an Apple product. The app also offers widgets for your home screen to switch between ANC, Transparency and Off (normal) modes, which is helpful if you set the button to activate voice assistant.","Reviewed in the United States August 10, 2024",AH5673U2MJGG46XTKJMDJPPRFG2A,True,0,Color: RedStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+
R3W44HXR3GUPIE,B096SV8SJG,4.0 out of 5 stars Makes sense for price.,Bee,4,"I am not a sound junkie, so take my review as someone who knows nothing about specs, quality, etc.Performance wise, they do what I expect them to do. They play my music. The buds do not have ear detection, so you have to press play/pause anytime something interrupts you. The sound was also very low when I received them, as they were a used product, but a little configuration in my settings fixed that immediately. I had no issues pairing them. I do like that you can see battery level without opening the case, you just go to your bluetooth icon and it‚Äôs there for both buds plus case.They‚Äôre not great at noise cancelling if I had to compare to say, AirPod pros. They‚Äôre more noise reducing, so if that‚Äôs your driving point with these you will not get what you are looking for. They do utilize spatial audio too, but again it‚Äôs just enough to say it‚Äôs there.Comfort wise, I like how they fit in my ear. Downside if I am working out they will fall out if I start sweating. They have squishy tips though which I do enjoy.Putting them in the case can be confusing. If you drop the case they will fly out though. Upside to that, these bad boys have survived my washer and dryer three times so far with no hit to the existing quality of sound or performance.Appearance wise they are really small, if you have long hair you could easily hide these during whatever you are doing.I got the black color, pretty standard. Nothing too different than what‚Äôs pictured.They‚Äôre extremely lightweight too (reference back to dropping the case) so I do suggest a protective case if you need some weight to it.

The quality of sound is perfect (coming from a bass-lover), the battery is long lasting, they‚Äôre cute and not too bulky, and they are very resilient. So much so that they survived a full wash and dry cycle without ANY damage - I thought they were goners after that but it‚Äôs been a couple of months and I have experienced no issues with sound, battery, anything. With all of this being said, my favorite thing about these headphones is by far the noise cancellation.

R2FJ02IAUY08JQ,B096SV8SJG,3.0 out of 5 stars Not Worth the Hype: Disappointing Features Despite Good Sound Quality,KFCC,3,"**Review:**I really wanted to like these, but after using them for almost a week, I find them poor in everything except for the relatively good sound when playing music. They are absolutely unusable for my work, which involves video conferencing. This is a deal-breaker.**Pros:**- Sound Quality: The mids are nice and clear, and the bass is tight and punchy when the volume is turned up. When listening to the right kind of music at high volumes, they can sound downright amazing. I appreciate the trueness of the sound, especially given my diverse music tastes from reggae to hip hop, jazz, R&B, and EDM.- Fit: They sit very snug in my ears, effectively blocking out external sounds, which provides a passive noise-canceling effect.**Cons:**- Noise Cancelling and Transparency Modes: Both modes fall short of expectations. Transparency mode, which should let you hear your surroundings, instead adds a hollow reverb and doesn't work well; I couldn‚Äôt even hear someone talking directly to me while using it. Noise cancellation mode introduces a persistent noise layer, similar to wind or the sea, rather than effectively blocking external sounds.- Controls: The physical buttons are a matter of personal preference. For me, they are frustrating and cumbersome, often leading to accidental pausing of the music, restarting the track, or skipping to the previous track. I find touch-sensitive controls more intuitive. Maybe I'll get used to it over time, but currently, it‚Äôs quite inconvenient.- Bluetooth Range: Disappointingly low with frequent disconnections even at moderate distances. To be honest, they perform similarly to the Earfun Air Pro 3, but I expected them to be better. Maybe I need to cut them some slack since they're a year older (2021) than the Earfun Air Pro 3.- Microphone Quality: Sounds horrible and robotic on a PC, making it unusable for video conferencing or recordings. I need to test the call quality on mobile.**Conclusion:**Overall, I'm not convinced these earbuds live up to the hype or their price. Despite impressive sound quality and numerous positive reviews, I want to be objective and make an informed decision. Here are the questions I‚Äôm considering:- Am I being more critical because of the price?- Is the fact that the normal mode sounds amazing with the passive noise-canceling from the fit enough to overlook the underwhelming or broken modes?- Should I use these earbuds just for music and avoid using them for work, which heavily relies on video conferencing on PC?- Will the microphone performance be better on mobile?- Will the fit remain as good when working out or sweating?- What will happen if they fall into a puddle of water?- Can they handle 8 hours of continuous work without causing fatigue?I realize that I can‚Äôt fully trust online reviews, particularly with notable brands where reviewers might be enamoured by the brand itself or the product‚Äôs popularity. This can lead to mismatched expectations between what is advertised and what actually meets my needs. I‚Äôll continue to test these earbuds in various scenarios to make a more informed decision.","Reviewed in the United States July 24, 2024",AEMRF56YHKNWCKBIVLXZTGEV753A,True,1,Color: RedStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+
R3QIOBHH01818S,B096SV8SJG,4.0 out of 5 stars Ok but not excellent for Beats,Amy L.,4,"I bought these renewed so keep that in mind before reading further. Aesthetically, he quality of the product is good, arrived clean, in the original box with charger and manuals. I like the design of the case (small enough to tuck away but big enough to keep track of.) 10/10. The headphones performance though are just ok and that's coming from a long time Beats fan. I bought these specifically because I lost one of my Beats Fit Pro pods (special edition ones that I can't get replaced or don't want to pay 2/3 the cost to do), anyway, these were an affordable backup. Sadly, these particular beats are lacking in sound quality, battery life, and noise cancellation.-Sound quality: 6.5/10 overall for sound with music. The sounds is quite low, volume on the device playing needs to be almost at max to hear comfortably for phone calls or audio/podcasts. Expected more oomph like my other sets.- Battery Life: 6/10. I charged them fully the first night and used them for a 1hr workout and for a few hours of a work shift. The case and headphones were completely dead the next morning without charge. So only one full day of use on a charge which again is starkly different from my Beats Fit Pros that lasted for up to 5-7 days without needing another charge. Boo.Noise Cancellation: 4/10 Probably the most obvious and my least favorite feature of these headphones is the noise cancellation. Even with one headphone in, you can hear absolutely nothing in the surroundings. I know some would love this, but other Beats models have the ambient sound option that allows you to hear the headphone audio AND the surrounding area comfortable. I feel like I'm wearing a hearing aid with these.One perk: Unlike other beats these headphones are interchangeable (at least for me). I was able to swap ears which is nice.Overall Rating: 7/10-Not great, but not terrible.

These Beats Studio Buds were available at another retailer, but not in this red color. I was excited to be able to purchase this red for the same price here at Amazon. Sometimes my little fingers have difficulty pulling the ear bud out of its case, but that may be because of these arthritic fingers. I also question if the battery life is as long as stated. I love the fact that I can connect to music with the press of a button. However, that same button is so sensitive that sometimes I end up disconnecting a caller.

Three days later I received the renewed ear buds, which are now working just fine.I would recommend purchasing used ear buds at the reduced price since Apple will honor warranty and repair or replace, which Amazon will not do, but will only refund purchase price.","Reviewed in the United States July 31, 2024",AE6RUVMPIW6ABPCRMHW6R5P2EUMQ,True,0,Color: RedStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+

RZSTHLOHCJIJV,B096SV8SJG,4.0 out of 5 stars Audio quality if quite good and ANC works well but transparency leaves a lot to be desired.,bigyuki555,4,"Audio quality if quite good and ANC works well but transparency leaves a lot to be desired.I switched from AirPod Pro1 after nearly 5 years of daily use believing that the Beats are new and normally only about $75 less than the AirPod Pro so the quality should be pretty similar between 5-year-old AirPods and brand-new Beats, and according to the text descriptions they are...but there is a remarkable difference in performance on the transparency mode.To the point where just having the earbuds in your ears and nothing playing is not any better than just having old style earbuds/earplugs in your ears. Transparency mode is supposed to make it easier to recognize sounds and voices so that you know when to unplug and listen, but it rarely works out that way with these.Score down on the battery life for the fact that the Transparency mode uses more battery but doesn't work well.That said the ANC works well and the audio quality for music (including Dolby Atmos), phone calls, and spoken word/podcast is superb. If you are most interested in audio quality and noise cancellation, then the Beats will tick your boxes.","Reviewed in the United States June 25, 2024",AHPF7TUW7QLABIRVWV55ORHEXFXA,True,1,Color: Moon GrayStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+

R16IK0B2PIQL2Z,B096SV8SJG,3.0 out of 5 stars Questionable Battery Life,Tyler Piechowiak,3,"Cost (4/5): Was searching for good quality BT earbuds while staying around a $100 budget. These seemed to be right in the range, granted I did add the apple warranty thing for an additional $20-30 dollars (will more than likely need it based on the battery life details below)Sound Quality (4.5/5): Good quality and base in my opinion, but I don't really have anything to compare them to.Case Quality (3/5): Case is made up of very thin plastic material with a flip open lid. I dropped this once already when getting out of my vehicle (I guess it was in my lap) and thought for sure it was going to implode on impact with the pavement, but luckily it didn't. Still questionable if it would survive a second drop though.Battery Life (1/5): I must have received a very poor pair of earbuds, because the page here shows ""24 hours with the two additional charges from the case"". If you do the math here, that's 8 hours per charge with the earbuds which is an absolute lie for the pair I received. At most, I'm getting about 90 minutes of continuous play before they are dropping to about 10-15% life. My right ear bud seems to always drain energy faster than the left ear bud as well. Typically when I check the right one is about 15+% lower than the left for battery life. IF the two charges is correct for the case, then I'm looking at a total of 4.5 hours of battery life with the two charges from the case. Very big difference here vs what was advertised, granted removing them every 90 minutes or so is ideal to prevent my ears from getting annoyed/sore with the buds being in so long.","Reviewed in the United States August 16, 2024",AGXTAHEJOKGJE3SGZZY2SBKQ3GIQ,True,0,Color: BlackStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+

Here's my review after a week of usage. This Beats ear buds has :> Amazing sound quality (I'm not a music professional; so not sure about the little nuances).> Noise cancellation is really good. I could listen to my stuff, while my family watches TV in the same room. Even with the bud in one ear, the sound filtering and clarity are a lot better than what I expected.> You also get an option to turn on and off the noise cancellation. With the noise cancellation off (i.e., transparency) you can hear outside sounds clearer (not as clear as without the ear buds though).> There are options in the bluetooth settings page (iOS) where the ""press & hold"" function of the ear buds stem can be toggled between ""noise control / Siri"" and turn on ""volume control"".> Battery life is very impressive. For my use case to listen to podcast and music, it lasts for several hours (atleast so far).> When the buds are put in the case, it magnetically latches in the right position.> It fits perfectly in the ear. It has the soft eartips that works better than an airpod pro for me.> It has the ""Find My"" option to locate if misplaced.Just a couple of features that i wish were better if addressed:> Auto audio turn off when the buds are taken off of the ear / falls off the ear. The audio continues in these cases. I.e., if you're listening to a podcast, wants to take it off for a few min and keeps it in your pocket, it can very well turn on accidentally (because it needs only a soft click to turn on) and the podcast would be over by the time you put it back on üòÜ.> No auto-pairing which is a bit annoying. It automatically connects to the last device it was connected. Each time you need to switch to a new device, the connection has to be established manually.> The three clicks for rewind does not usually take in properly, unless you manage to do the three clicks quite fast. If there is a millisecond delay between the presses, it considers it as a single click which is a command to stop.> If you're connecting to the laptop (Mac), the option to use ""noise control / siri"" Vs ""volume control"" seems to be either-or i.e., you may not have both at the same time.","Reviewed in the United States December 27, 2023",AHWVZ7UB4TNBZUSSELY6RB7RRCUA,True,20,Color: BlackStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+

That‚Äôs the only disappointing part is that battery life doesn‚Äôt last long over time of ownership. Great for listening to music all day long. I can‚Äôt hear when people come up to my desk. Very noise canceling. Phone calls can be a little hit or miss where it picks up all the background noise and the caller can‚Äôt hear me as well.","Reviewed in the United States June 4, 2024",AG4XTVMXSBIPFRX7W3F2J3BITGXA,True,2,Color: BlackStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+

It was easy to set up and pair and the sound is excellent. ""Transparency mode"", which allows some ambient sound, works very well without a huge impact on battery life. The only negative I can come up with so far is that the super high gloss finish on the buds can be challenging to grip, especially when removing them from the case. A light texture added just to the grip area would solve this without noticeably disrupting the cosmetics; something for the designers to consider.","Reviewed in the United States July 2, 2024",AGCJX4UIM2UJ4ZEAVA6EFZMQOJNA,True,5,Color: BlackStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+

RNDGVPHO1V4I5,B096SV8SJG,4.0 out of 5 stars Beats Studio Buds - A Symphony of Style and Sound,dwayne taylor,4,"I recently purchased the Beats Studio Buds - True Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds, and after spending some quality time with them, I am thoroughly impressed. These earbuds are a fantastic blend of style, functionality, and sound quality, making them a strong contender in the crowded market of wireless earbuds.Design and Comfort:The first thing that struck me about the Beats Studio Buds was their sleek and minimalist design. Available in a range of colors, they have a modern look that stands out without being too flashy. The earbuds are incredibly lightweight and come with three sizes of ear tips, ensuring a comfortable and secure fit. I wore them for hours without any discomfort, which is a big plus for anyone who uses earbuds extensively throughout the day.Sound Quality:Beats has always been known for its emphasis on bass, and the Studio Buds do not disappoint in this regard. The sound is rich and immersive, with a well-balanced profile that doesn't overly skew towards bass. The mids and highs are crisp and clear, making these earbuds suitable for a wide range of music genres. Whether I was listening to classical, rock, or hip-hop, the audio quality remained consistently impressive.Noise Cancellation and Transparency Mode:The active noise cancellation (ANC) on the Beats Studio Buds is a standout feature. It effectively blocks out ambient noise, allowing for an immersive listening experience even in noisy environments. The transparency mode is equally impressive, letting in just enough sound to keep you aware of your surroundings without diluting the audio quality of what you're listening to.Battery Life and Connectivity:The battery life of the Beats Studio Buds is solid, offering about 8 hours of listening time and more with the charging case. The earbuds also support fast charging, which is a lifesaver when you need a quick boost. Connectivity-wise, they pair seamlessly with both iOS and Android devices, and the connection remains stable even at a distance.Controls and Functionality:The touch controls are intuitive and responsive, allowing for easy management of playback, calls, and ANC modes. I found the controls to be quite user-friendly, with minimal accidental touches.Conclusion:Overall, the Beats Studio Buds - True Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds are an excellent choice for anyone looking for high-quality sound, effective noise cancellation, and stylish design in their earbuds. They strike a perfect balance between performance and aesthetics, making them suitable for both casual listeners and audiophiles alike. While they may be a bit pricey, the quality you get justifies the investment. Highly recommended for anyone in the market for a premium wireless earbud experience.","Reviewed in the United States December 27, 2023",AGIAJSPIKY6ECFRXNA6BPVLSNG3A,True,11,Color: RedStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+

RGTK8PYYGJ2FG,B096SV8SJG,5.0 out of 5 stars The Best Bass I've Heard from Earbuds,Matthew hoffacker,5,"These earbuds pack an incredible punch, I rated the noise canceling a 4 because i notice a slight decrease in audio quality whilst on since the drivers are dedicating some of their power to canceling out whatever noise is playing.The Unboxing Experience: Apple does Apple really well. All of their products have an amazing unboxing experience curated for them. These lil guys are no exception, I even noticed the piece the earphones are attached to is like a inch thick piece of cardboard that feels more akin to metal than cardboard.THEY HAVE BUTTONS: Yes all of the major earbuds have controls on the units themselves but none that I've used have implemented buttons so well. These buds have a physical clicky button on each earbud that clicks with just enough pressure to negate accidental touches but not so much pressure that your shoving an earbud driver down your ear canal. Another instance of these buds implementing what others have better.From an Android user: These pair exactly like any galaxy buds would and or apple products to an iphone. You open the case and if you have bluetooth on it has a cool little animation of your product on the phone and its a one click pairing system. Incredibly easy.Connecting to a laptop: Your case must have a charge or be plugged in for these to pair to a laptop. Theres a button in between the buds that if held for 3 seconds sends the buds into a pairing mode where they function much like any other bluetooth product on the market.BASS: YES IT DOES.Price: I got these whilst they were on lightning deal for 79.99 and at that price they are unbeatable. I've come from multiple pairs of bluetooth earbud solutions such as Quiet comfort buds from bose, samsung galaxy buds orginial and pro and pro 2, and Ive even tried both airpod pros and standard airpods. With having tried all of these I see benefits to having one pair over the other but with that price being a major standout reason these buds are now my favorite option for wireless earbuds.OVERALL: These things are freaking sweet and if you can find them on sale you should most definitely be considering them as your next daily driver. Battery, Bass, android compatability, style points for someone who grew up in the early 2000s (used to love those big over ears hanging around my neck i thought i was so cool) and although i didn't focus much on their noise canceling in my review they do that well enough to switch on as needed. If you're trying to enjoy the sound quality of a song as much as possible i would just suggest getting ear tips that fit well and seal. Even with NC turned off these things seal so well I can barely hear my own thoughts - rather just bass rattling - just the way i like it.9.5/10 Really not much you could do better with them.","Reviewed in the United States December 31, 2023",AE6EQLGONN4MPXYFETOA3GDK7WBA,True,41,Color: BlackStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+

The quality is alright but could be better. My biggest disappointment was how they aren‚Äôt too compatible with Siri. I‚Äôm a delivery driver so I can‚Äôt always pull out my phone to unlock it and reply to texts. I came from air pods and air pods will read you texts as they come and let you reply WITHOUT unlocking your phone. These beats DO NOT do that, they won‚Äôt read texts and if you ask if you have new messages it will require you to unlock your phone. Also the Siri voice sounds a little muffled and it doesn‚Äôt always pick up what you say when you do use voice to text. That‚Äôs the most disappointing thing about these, I thought since they were bought out by Apple years ago they would imply the same software but no.Overall they‚Äôre decent, nothing to out of the ordinary.The noise canceling is nice. They also come with different sized rubber attachments so you can swap them out if they don‚Äôt fit right.Another thing I might add is that they‚Äôre a little bulky. The first few days of using them my ears would be sore just from wearing them. Again on sale they‚Äôre worth it ($80) but at full price ($150) I would‚Äôve been much more disappointed.Overall the sound quality is crisp but I personally feel like it could use a little more bass, these tend to be louder with the quality of voice over the quality of the music.That being said the battery life is okay, it‚Äôs nice that the case charges them. There‚Äôs also no way to see the battery levels of the case unless you have an iPhone and open the case near it. On the case itself it only has a small light that turns red when low.","Reviewed in the United States December 25, 2023",AFFMX6QW56DDKHV6PJ4JGPCEPVNA,True,21,Color: RedStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+

The charge lasts a long time, the bass is better than the ones I‚Äôve had before, the base is even better than the JBL‚Äôs, and sometimes they have these on sale for $60 as well so keep an eye out on that. I wear earbuds every day and these have been by far my favorite. I‚Äôm sure theres some other very good ones but that‚Äôs if you‚Äôre willing to pay 250-$300. Yet why pay that when these are pretty on par to those ones. I would say give these a try. Everything is great, the Sound quality and the noise cancellation. I only have one thing bad to say. You can‚Äôt go very far from your phone with these, that‚Äôs the only thing because they will cut out. Yet most of the time you‚Äôre gonna be close to whatever you‚Äôre watching or listening to anyways. I‚Äôll always buy this brand. Seriously the bass on these is better than any earbuds I‚Äôve used. Great for gaming, watching Tv/youtube, music, and everything. Also there‚Äôs an awareness mode that lets you hear what‚Äôs around you in life if you need to pay attention to stuff outside while you listen to whatever. Very easy to use when it comes to switching modes.","Reviewed in the United States July 29, 2024",AHVXJD7XEAP533ZBBWESWLYBDGVQ,True,24,Color: Royal Blue

I‚Äôve seen some advertisements for these so I decided to try them out and what can I say these are great little ear buds:Pros:Comfortable- these fit in your ears with no little tail that sticks out of your ears. This is an added plus for me cause I can actually sleep with them in with no issue.Battery life - so far battery life seems above and beyond other brands was stuck in a delayed flight for 2 hrs plus the 4 hr flight time and still had 40% battery life according to my phone.Sound - great sound and 3 different options to choose from depending on your preference or music choice.Price: Cheaper than most comparable brands.Cons:The charging case - the charging case is small and compact, but the lid is very thin and I feel like it could easily be broken off if you aren‚Äôt careful with it.Awareness mode, I feel like there is still some noise isolation in awareness mode and I sometimes don‚Äôt feel as though I‚Äôm as present in the environment as I should be with that mode enabled.Fit: while I don‚Äôt have an issue I can see people with smaller ears may have an issue with the retention of the buds in their ears.No tracking: I get these aren‚Äôt integrated into the various tracking apps that phones these days have, but it would be nice if it were integrated cause these things are small in their case.","Reviewed in the United States June 23, 2024",AEZWOV2DA5KHY7LUJE2LQN7E6HNQ,True,22,
R1LFS8RDVSK7IZ,B0CTD6PRBY,5.0 out of 5 stars My favorite ear buds!!!,SuzyLane,5,"Got the blue ones. These were a hand-me-down from my stepson. He said they would hurt his ears ""after a while."" A while is approximately 1hr-10hrs, 'cause he used them while gaming. Other than that, he loved them. Did a lot of research prior to buying and these seemed the best for him.I use them for listening to Pandora, while walking the dog, as well as using just one, so I can hear myself playing acoustic bass, and singing along with whatever's playing on them. I used to design loudspeakers for Polk Audio in the mid 80's till mid-90's. Done my fair share of critical listening, and won't buy or use anything else, regardless of price. Polks are simply the best.I love my lil buds!!! I've used others in the past: JBL - nice, and quality-made. Motorola (w. headband) - pure junk - stay away. Sony (both wired and wireless) actually my 2nd favorite - but for the price, excellent. Monster over head big phones - liked them way better than Beats' shrill, and boomy sound, but, couldn't get a good fit, w their buds. KOSS wired el cheapos - great value, and audiophile-quality sound, but, very flimsy, and not as good as these, soundwise, for my personal taste. Koss buds - ok sound and mic, terrible build quality. Polk Audio buds - best I've ever heard of ANY headset - and worth the price if you can find them, slightly used. Mackie - meh - loud. Bose buds - excellent, but, terrible warranty and cust. service. Bose over-ears - nothing spectacular. Sennheiser - love mine, and they're 40 years old. Modded to fit inside Howard Leight V3, over-ear noise cancelling phones - and they're my in-house go-to for accurate sound reproduction, amateur recording, and over-all listening. Sennheiser wireless w. transmitter - outstanding for late-night watching or gaming. Almost completely silent to others', nearby, when in use. Very accurate surround sound reproduction. Slightly expensive, but, worth it. Nothing else compares in this price range. - Need a lot of AA batteries to use. Also tried other brands, but, none were as nice as these.The bass in these is incredible. You can ""feel"" the subsonic frequencies. No other buds were able to replicate lower bass frequencies as well as these. Not even close.Clarity of sound. You can hear every nuance of the recording. Every song sounds better, and I've discovered sounds and parts of songs, which I've never heard through ANY listening device. Not overhead earphones, and I'm talking expensive studio-quality gear, costing 100x more than these lil buds. You can hear every instrument, in its ""location"" on the stage, or studio, if different. Even the player's fingertips when playing, or using other plucking techniques. You can hear the singer's breath while singing in the song. Amazing big-room, studio, hall, or live concert sound reproduction. The Who's Quadrophenia is like nothing I've heard before, regardless of system, period. I've tried all the different sound options, but, being a bassist, I stick w/ the Bass setting. It's louder, and actually clearer. They've never distorted on me, except through a generic free smartphone. Sound varies somewhat through PCs, laptops, and other cell phones, but it always sounds good.The color is nice. They match my car's color, lol. Quality build. I've dropped them, sat on them, stepped on them, and went a whole summer of high temps, sweat, and rain. A few charging issues, due to dust in the charging port, and my failure to use them as instructed. You can also charge them wirelessly!!! Bluetooth works every time, quickly and flawlessly. I, usually, get about a month, before it's time to recharge the base. This depends on charger, charging method, and amount of daily use.All that at a fair price... some would even say, inexpensive, compared w. other 'phones which cost WAY more. Obviously I recommend these ear buds.Bottom line - get these!","Reviewed in the United States December 3, 2022",AHKXF5CQBBXVZ5XCHBOKFZNWXNNA,True,393,
R11WL0PQCOXFC0,B0CTD6PRBY,5.0 out of 5 stars Clarity and Ease of use.,JamesR,5,"I was skeptical of buying these over many other brands because I was not familiar with Raycon. To my pleasant surprise, they are incredible. When I got them in the mail, I at first thought they sent me an empty box, they are so light. Mine were already charged and ready to go when I received them. It came in a white colored box cover but when you removed this there was a very sharp black box which you could actually use as a present, it was this nice. Opening the box, you had three smaller boxes, one for the strap and usb. One for the earpieces, and the last for the minimal instructions. The Ear buds themselves were contained in the main box itself. This was a very classy presentation, and I was excited to try this out.Connection was quite easy and the clarity... Amazing, the music felt like it was inside my head, and I could hear every word within the songs. [As a side note, I realized I misunderstood some song lyrics for years.] As a veteran, and in my 60's I have some hearing loss, but I tell you truly, listening to music through this device is incredible. For the price, this is a steal. I cannot comment on battery life at this time because I only have had these for 24hrs. Lastly, I thought they would fall out because of how light they were but incredibly I could go on a brisk walk, and they didn't budge at all, very nice.Postives: Very inexpensive for what you are getting. A great presentation box, beautiful color [Mine is Candy Apple Red], Ease of use, Very Light, Comfortable and the Clarity is amazing for what I paid for it.Negatives: The only downsides to me where the instructions that came in the box. I had to go to the internet and type Raycon instructions to find out how to actually use them. The only other possible negative was choosing the correct earpiece for your ears. They are small and are really easy to drop and lose. They are also a little difficult to actually put on the earbuds themselves, but this is true of all earbuds I have used in the past. My recommendation is to try the pair that is already on the buds, if they fall out, they are too big for your inner ear. I had to use the smallest set to get them to fit correctly.","Reviewed in the United States March 16, 2024",AE65XNQETGZ2LEDHFJZZFOSLOXUQ,True,129,
RYAMZZ5FH81G8,B0CTD6PRBY,"3.0 out of 5 stars Solid ""B"" grade. 3.5 stars, Music sounds great, phone works great, awareness mode needs help.",MDM,3,"I got the E25's, black. Packaging is nice, comes with a brief, clearly written user manual which I used right away to see how to change the sound options. I use a Samsung Galaxy S20 FE 5G, and I took these buds out of the package, directly out of the case and put them right in. The default female voice told me they were powered on right away, sounding in both ears, in the order i put them in. Opened bluetooth options on my phone and they were already listed as ""Raycon Everyday Buds."" I touched the name and they connected right off without any issue whatsoever. Hit play on my music, and I love the sound. I just opened them today, so I'm waiting to see how these endure before giving full stars.The button in each bud is a physical push button, a bubble that clicks. I like it because the sweaty strap from my bike helmet won't press it inadvertently like my old buds that just had ""touch control."" You can't see the bud when you reach up to touch it, so it's always a game of fumbling with where to touch it and how many ""touches"" would register. Especially when on the mountain bike, that frustrated me, but maybe you like it (wierdo)...Sound quality:I love all three modes. ""Balanced, Bass and Pure"" they all sound good while bringing in their individual strengths. For piano pieces, like Paul Cardall or Ludivico Eiunadi, Pure Sound is precise. For Van Halen, Nightwish, and Godsmack, Balanced sound and Bass modes are excellent. It's all subjective anyway, but I can hear the details and fairly crisp sounds.Awareness Mode:This is my first time trying buds that have a mode where they claim to allow you to hear ambient noise around you while still enjoying the music. Raycon calls it ""Awareness Mode"". It works, but not as i had hoped. In my mind, I had anticipated being able to speak while listening to my music and hear my voice and others' clearly through the electronic mic instead of through jawbone vibrations like when you plug your ears with your fingers and speak. These buds can do that, but you can only hear it faintly, and I find myself wishing I could turn up that volume. But if I turn it up, only the music gets louder and the ambient sounds are left behind as the music grows in volume. The ambient sound volume is constant, and only works well if I turn the music off. Which is a disapponting feature because then what's the point? Without the music, I might as well remove the buds right? All buds claim to have powerful noise canceling, but what I'm hoping for is exactly the opposite, I want to hear my music and all the ambient sounds while biking, running, and working at my computer. It should be like hearing the world around me but with cool music that nobody else can hear. Why isn't this an option? Maybe I'm the wierdo.The fit is okay... It comes with multiple gel sizes. The default sizes were a bit tight, so I downsized them by one, and they are comfortable for about 15 minutes then I have to push them in again. Not quite settled on which size of gel I should be using. This shouldn't be that difficult but...UPDATE: 8/24/22I've had them for over a month now. Still working as they did they day I opened them.*The container charges in just a couple hours*The longest I have had these in is about 5 hours, my ears became fatigued from the fit before the battery ran out while I was backpacking. The buds charged up and container still had more than 50%*PHONE CALLS: I haven't had problems hearing clear audio from the phone calls. When I ask the other caller how I sound they have told me I'm difficult to hear well. If i turn off Bluetooth and speak directly into the phone they report my sound as being much better. Not impressed with the microphone quality. But I have had no problems at all hearing the other caller clearly.*I have not yet had any connection problems with my phone*I still am disappointed with the Awareness Mode. It's very underwhelming compared to my daughter's Jabra Elite Active 75 earbuds with the same feature. Those are significantly better in this regard.*I wear these while mountain biking, they stay in fine, but I don't bomb down the mountain either.*I really wish I had the ability to adjust the equalizer settings but it's fixed in stone. The app is a complete joke, no functionality at all. No my friend, if you want to adjust the equalizer, these are not for you. I do wish I could adjust the bass to be more pronounced, and the highs to be a bit sharper.12/2/2022 UPDATE: over 1 year ownership..I still have these and they still work as described above, they hold charge forever. But at this point I'm ready for a different pair just because of the phone call quality and the weak awareness mode. I've also found that I can't remember how to use all the features because the push button functions aren't very intuitive, and no app to use for adjustments. I can answer a phone call, one push in either ear, but the quality is still reported as ""difficult to hear."" I'm going to be buying a different brand.You should buy these if:-You don't care about the awareness Mode-You just want something that holds charge very well and will last a long time.-Plays music with clear quality and have no desire to mess with sound settings.-You want something with rock solid, reliable, connectivity.You should not buy these if:-You want to talk on the phone a lot-You want to hear the details of what's going on around you clearly while still listening to loud music-You like to adjust the equalizer","Reviewed in the United States July 23, 2022",AEALUFESZ2ILQK6QHBIASNCGQFMQ,True,843,
R1VYTUMHBGLI4G,B0CTD6PRBY,2.0 out of 5 stars ‚ÄúFeature upgrades‚Äù seem to be rendered completely useless by design changes (review in progress‚Ä¶),SunnyLK,2,"I had 4 pairs of the previous autocorrection.cancel (because 1- I wasn‚Äôt the best about remembering to charge, & 2- I am the WORST about losing the case, 1 or both buds, etc; I listen to audio books in bed & frequently have to search the bed/sheets in the morning if I fall asleep while listening, as frequently happens). I LOVED the previous model, and recommended them to everyone.Unfortunately (but unsurprisingly), I lost a pair in the capsule a couple weeks ago & I replaced with the 2024 model. I have used them twice now, and here is my honest opinion. (Reference: I use Apple devices, if it matters to anyone)Appearance: 3-4 stars - They look like earbuds. Not a huge range of colors available. I‚Äôm not a big fan of the muted colors, preferring the strong jewel tones, but that‚Äôs personal preference. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if more colors become available later.Sound Quality: 4-5 stars - I don‚Äôt often listen to music, using buds mostly for podcasts, videos, tv shows on devices, & audiobooks. Even when occasionally listening to music, I don‚Äôt change the sound settings. As with the older model, you must ensure they are seated correctly to get the best sound (put in correct ear & rotate forward).Network/Bluetooth Setup: 5 stars - Easy to use with Apple devices. Turn on, open your Bluetooth menu and select the device. It was good for ME that the new model shows up as a slightly different name as the previous model, so it was easy to tell which device to connect to.Features: 5 stars - Sound canceling is great; I frequently put earbuds in to listen to news, tv, podcasts to allow hubby use of the tv. Additionally, hubby fired a shotgun outside the window to kill a snake & I barely HEARD the shot, only FELT it, & I don‚Äôt turn anything up loud, usually listening at less than half volume. Noise canceling turns on & off, & I was surprised at the difference.Device Range: 5 stars - I can leave device in one end of the house and go to the other side without losing connectivity, only having minor skipping if I bend down (changing bed sheets, eg).Battery Life: 2-3 stars - This is Raycon‚Äôs big distinguishing feature & there seems to be a change from previous models. Seems earbud battery life has been shortened by 1-2 hr, but that the case can now provide 3 charges of 2 earbuds rather than 2, & earbuds are fully charged in ~10 min. The quick charge is great, additional charges are nice (now 4 charges if everything fully charged as opposed to 3).Comfort: 2-3 stars - I am small woman, earbuds themselves are a little large for my ears. As long as they are properly seated, they are comfortable, but if I fall asleep with them in, I have frequently woken up to remove them because they hurt. This is more my fault than that of the product, these are LOADS more comfortable than the Skullcandy earbuds I used previously.**Ease of Use: 0-1 Stars** - This is where the new product falls short to me. Like everything electronic these days, the device thinks it knows what you want rather than giving you the ability to control these things yourself, and frequently assumes you are stupid. I do not know if Raycon has an app because I never needed one before, but I suppose I‚Äôll be checking after writing this review.When listening at night, I only want to use 1 earbud, but will remove both from case & turn 1 off, because I frequently fall asleep, & lose earbuds. However, these earbuds do not have a physical button, but rather a touch surface. Thankfully, you do have to press the ‚Äúbutton‚Äù (surface) with your finger. In an attempt to ensure earbuds maintain max bat life, I want to charge them together after full bat discharge. However, after the first night of usage, I awoke to TWO dead earbuds rather than 1. The next night (last night), I had to take PARTICULAR CARE to set the unused bud on the little ceramic tray I use just for this purpose, and had a charged Bud this morning. However, after my office cleared and I turned off the earbud to listen (again, TAKING PARTICULAR CARE to watch finger placement as I removed the earbud), I noticed the earbud SWITCHED ITSELF ON AGAIN. I have no memory touching it (but I probably did), but for practical purposes, the d*mn thing turned itself on. I had to turn off my Bluetooth so I could be sure that, if it couldn‚Äôt find a connection, it would switch back off.**THIS IS A PROBLEM.** It completely erases the Raycon‚Äôs distinguishing featur & primary selling point- the charging case- if you‚Äôre spending these charges recharging the device after it mysteriously switches itself on (whether by accidental bump, failure to take PARTICULAR CARE when handling, etc). With a shortened battery life in the device itself, this makes this problem even more egregious. Like EVERYONE, I have a busy life & my time is valuable. If I need to make a call while driving & only have a limited bit of time to make that call during that drive, or if I need to be on a conference call at a certain time, I need confidence that my device will be in the state I EXPECT it to be in; this is why I happily paid for 4 other pairs of Raycon, to ensure I had what I needed when I needed it & to match my habits/lifestyle. I like/appreciate the new rapid charge, but the device‚Äôs unfortunate habit of turning itself on kind of negates this feature.My devices need to make my life easier and behave reliably. If I must fight with them, or they are unavailable when I expect them to be, then they are not adding value, saving time, or allowing me to multi-task, they are creating additional problems that I need to deal with, and I don‚Äôt have the patience for that.I‚Äôm an engineer, so naturally, I DID NOT read the instruction manual (I never NEEDED to, before; they‚Äôre freaking earbuds, not nuclear missiles), but in order to give the product a fair chance, I will read the d*mn thing & see if any available apps might help with the issues I‚Äôm having, but thus far, have been extremely disappointed. Would rate the new 2024 model somewhere between 1.5-2 stars overall, after being a loyal customer previously (this is my 5th pair, after all).Because I‚Äôve only used for 2 days, I have not discovered whether these will connect to my phone while still in the charging case as the old model would, but as this was only when the case was on its final charge; it was an irritating problem, but one I could live with. If that turns out to be an issue with this model as well, then these WILL be replaced, IMMEDIATELY. This new design already has too many problems, and adding another- a problem already known but not fixed- will be a dealbreaker for me. Releasing a ‚Äúnew model‚Äù is much less important than having a reliable product without any ‚Äúunadvertised design features‚Äù that are actually ‚Äúdesign flaws/bugs‚Äù. Devices should not automatically turn on & burn battery just to auto connect to a device. If it is supposed to (though I can‚Äôt think of a reason WHY earbuds SHOULD auto connect if they aren‚Äôt in use, they can‚Äôt be charged while in your ears, and why burn battery life if they aren‚Äôt in use?), that feature should be able to be toggled.Of course, I‚Äôm also the idiot that thinks one should be able to tune their own algorithms in search engines & SM recommendations rather than allowing companies to attempt to predict what IT thinks I‚Äôm asking (a conclusion I reached while shopping new washers after spending an hour searching HOW a ‚Äúdirt sensor‚Äù works on a washing machine and getting 5 pages of AI-generated garbage results that tell me, in nearly identical language WHAT it is and how wonderful it was, and how it was probably going to single-handedly save the world before finally finding the answer I was looking for: it was a turbidity meter that probably wouldn‚Äôt work so great when your house has its own water well, like mine does), so perhaps it‚Äôs just me.To those about to reach the end, I salute you. You deserve a medal of some kind, but honestly, I‚Äôm just a salty old engineer who wants her d*mn earbuds to work the way she expects, so I have zero‚Ä¶ medals to give. Will try to remember to update if I have anything relevant to add to review.

R27TV504DW6UCH,B0CTD6PRBY,"4.0 out of 5 stars Great Earbuds, With Some Slight Issues",Ryan Baldwin,4,"Let me first say that these earbuds are comfortable and have great sound. The quality seems premium (despite being made of plastic) and I like the design mashup of gloss and matte surfaces. Still, I have a couple small gripes.For reference, I'm comparing these to a pair of Samsung Galaxy Buds that are a few years old. I think the sound and overall clarity on these may be better than the Samsungs, though it's also likely time to replace those. My main issue comes down to two things: The case and the touch controls.The case is a good size and weight and has good battery life. My issue is with the USB-C port placement: It's on the BOTTOM of the case. This means that it can't sit flat to open it and take out the earbuds. The Samsung Buds have the port on the back it sits flat facing you and you can easily open the top to remove or replace the earbuds. I feel like the port should've been relocated or the case redesigned on the Raycons.Second, the touch controls aren't great. Maybe I'm just too used to the Galaxy Buds and the companion app for use with my Samsung phone, but the Raycons seem slow to respond to single taps for volume, often causing me to either wait to see if the touch registered or tap multiple times not realizing that it did register earlier taps and I end up turning the volume up higher than I intended. On the Samsungs it's tap for play/pause, long tap/hold for volume increase/decrease, and double tap for skip forward. The small window they give you to double tap to play/pause on the Raycons is so small as to make the control pointless. 9 times out of 10 I just end up accidentally turning up the volume.That being said, I do think they're high quality earbuds, just with some questionable design choices. If I learn I'm using it wrong later I'll gladly update this review. For now I'm giving them 4 stars. Sound quality, isolation, and Awareness Mode are great. Could use some reworking when it comes to controls.","Reviewed in the United States June 17, 2024",AF7CQWTKJSA4FULYES5MYLNSU7VA,True,9,Color: Carbon Black

So expect to buy a longer one aswellReally the only other con I can think of if you can even call it that is the 3 different sound modes, they all sound pretty similar and they‚Äôre isn‚Äôt a huge noticeable difference, so if your expecting this feature to be a good feature then you would be disappointed but I mean the sound in general is great soConclusion-these earbuds are one of the best I‚Äôve worn and I would definitely recommend, I‚Äôll be seeing and updating this review if anything changes but I doubt it, all in all solid earbuds for a price that‚Äôs significantly cheaper then other high quality earbuds(Apple, beats etc)UPDATE-So I bought these in February, they still are pretty good besides the volume somewhat going down in the left one but I mean it has noise cancellation and I can hear nothing at the gym with both in and music playing, another somewhat issue is the left falls out a lot, that may be my ears but it is what it is, overall my opinion hasn‚Äôt changed to much she‚Äôs were and still are amazing earbuds for how cheap they are.","Reviewed in the United States May 20, 2024",AE5AH4IPWHDU72VO55X4YCM3IOCQ,True,18,

Granted it was the last thing I was thinking about, but once I figured out I was OK and picked up the stuff I was carrying, I noticed the podcast I was listening to was still playing.Tried the noise canceling feature, really can't comment on it, since I normally tune out junk noise after about 5 to 10 minutes naturally (TV, music playing, traffic, kids playing/screaming, pets making noise), trust me, if you can tune out 3 macaws acting out, you can tune out anything. üò¥Did get a cheap silicone case for the storage/charger, mostly so I can find it in my backpack or in my room easily. Picking a bright color has saved me, the person that pretty much everything handheld or smaller that he owns, is either black or navy blue.I found the default sound settings were OK. But once manually set to my personal tastes, even better. And setting them was rather easy for this boomer.Old reviewI'll start off on the fit. Slipped into both ears with the base buds.Pairing with my phone and laptop was easy and fast. They came with a 90% charge.Basic settings out of the box, nice base and treble balance. Have not tested the other sound features yet, so will update in a week or two.The only thing I wish that it came with a case, to put the charge/storage case in.","Reviewed in the United States June 27, 2024",AHNRNKGUWLH2EOXPHD7FOB33UOAA,True,0,Color: Royal Blue

I think I charge mine 1-2 times a week and I use them everyday at work.The only thing I found was they can be a little sore after using them for long periods. But I have quite small ears. I found it hard to get them in and comfortable. So definitely takes a bit of getting used to initially but once you‚Äôve found the correct way to put them in they are very comfortable. They have a few sizes for yhe in ear foams so that helps with getting them to fit your ear correctly.

They have good sound & mic quality, but every once in a while glitch & try to teather to something else Bluetooth which can be confusing. They are one of the best pairs you can buy right now & the auto on & off when you take them in and out of the recharging case is nice. Wish companies would stop skimping on the length of charging cords and provide wall plugs, not just usb. Some of us use these devices differently because we live rurally and don't work desk jobs.

R34EPLVP1IC19P,B0CTD6PRBY,3.0 out of 5 stars mixed feelings 3.5/5,Corbin Saastamoinen,3,"I bought the 2023 edition last year and they are fantastic, apart from the fact I lost 1 earbud. I bought new ones earlier in July hoping that the 2024 edition would meet the same expectations. I am not satisfied.The case's design doesn't allow you to easily know how much battery is left in the case before it needs to be charged, the earbuds are all touch-sensitive which I find annoying. I prefer the 2023's use of the buttons so you don't accidentally change the volume for example.Sometimes (it's very rare) but in my experience at least 1 earbud just does not want to charge. It could be an issue with the case not easily telling you how much battery is left in it.Yes, I am aware that the light changes color when the earbuds are charging, but, again as I mentioned earlier, it does not tell you how much charge is left in the case.To summarize, this is a downgrade of the 2023 edition in my opinion. I'm not saying they are bad, no I do believe that for the most part, you are getting your money's worth out of them. I think the previous version was better. Overall, I rate the 2023 version 4/5, but the 2024 version is a 3.5/5.","Reviewed in the United States August 24, 2024",AHRZMULFDFOUDULZ7WRL7ADVVQIA,True,2,Color: Royal Blue

R37MS1VY24Y1IL,B0CTD6PRBY,4.0 out of 5 stars Music on a Motorcycle,Nathan,4,"I was on the lookout for earbuds that work underneath my helmet and without one. I found many a product such as the JLab and Samsung wireless earbuds or the Shure and MEE wired earbuds. I choose these earbuds because it was on sale, and had a red color that matched my helmet. My main concern before it arrived was if it‚Äôll fall out my helmet in it or when I take it off. I had previously had AirPod Pros, but they would fall out easily while driving my motorcycle, maybe because the cushions weren‚Äôt the right size. Either way, I really hoped these would just stay in place and not fall out when I removed my helmet.When these arrived, I was decently surprised to find that these actually sealed and worked in comparison to my AirPod Pros. I even did a huge shake test running and jumping, and they didn‚Äôt fall out. Now, it was time to put it to the test by trying to put a helmet on and off, and hope it stays inside my ear. With putting it on, it actually stayed in and work perfectly fine, but on removal? It fell out my ears. I tried to keep it and pry the edges away from my ears any way I could, but to no avail. But then I tried on of my old helmets that fit me with a looser fit, and they actually stayed in on removal. I learned my helmet currently is a bit tight and that any earbud with that helmet would probably have trouble not coming out due my ear being pried every single time.Otherwise, it was time for the ultimate test: using it without a helmet. I was afraid the weight of it might drag it out, but actually, driving with them on felt pretty stable and I could still hear through them. The sound coming out was great and I didn‚Äôt need to have the music blaring. I ran it at about 70-80mph, and it stayed in. Any higher than that, and I don‚Äôt know to be quite honest.The awareness mode being off blocked out all the wind noise and sounded decent for noise cancellation. Great wind noise reduction, but not as great as the Pros, but not too loud such as‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶ not wearing any ear protection? Only problem is keeping the awareness mode on actually amplifies wind noise which is a blaring issue and causes excessive noise. It becomes unbearable when outside and is deafening, even just trying to talk to others.Overall, great earbuds for everyday use like it claims while also fitting in my helmet (except on removal) and without a helmet. Only con is awareness mode on isn‚Äôt great outside.","Reviewed in the United States October 14, 2023",AEW6SU5XVHBZ2GP45QLUJIQ6WE4A,True,30,

However, after a couple of uses the left earbud started to static, and when on cell, the earbuds disconnects and connects with a little voiceover. As you can imagine, having a call interrupted many times can be very frustrating. I contacted Raycon through Amazon to report the static and had them replaced- not sure if I should be concern that both packaging are very different, as pictured. Overall, customer service seems to be good, didn‚Äôt have high expectations due to the cost - but it exceeded my expectations on performance and the color is cute!","Reviewed in the United States September 7, 2024",AG4YYGMLFV4LHBZ56VIM4YK3JC2A,True,0,Color: Forrest Green

R27LPOZIZUVMSD,B0CTD6PRBY,"3.0 out of 5 stars Nice Sound, Constantly Fall out and Way to Easy to Accidentally Change settings",Cait,3,"These things have good sound. I also like the color, case and battery life.Here are the consCon One.Like many manufacturers, they lie about fitting any ear. To do that you need different shapes and different depths, as well as different sizes and likely little hooks. I have earplugs that manage it and somehow basic earbuds can succeed, probably because they're light weight. A tapered oval shape works well.My ear canal is very small and I don't have a big enough space for the earbuds to actually rest within my outer ear. The only thing keeping them in is the silicon ear pieces, and they barely manage that. I can feel the working their way out and have to catch them, bringing me to my next con.Con 2. If your ear buds are constantly falling out, you're gonna touch them, and, if you do, you'll change the settings, the volume, etc, way too easily. One of mine fell in my bra and apparently skin contact was enough to have them cycle through settings as I frantically tried to fish them out. I don't like the volume going to max in my other earbud that I've managed to keep in.They have good sound but for me they're only usable at home, without me moving at all. The claim they fit any ear size is so false and pretty much any manufacturer has multiple ear piece sizes, so they really haven't even tried to match that claim.","Reviewed in the United States June 18, 2024",AFTCEQST6F6TJ5S4WJXL56UZ4GFA,True,0,Color: Forrest Green
RA56J5XVZRA48,B0CTD6PRBY,3.0 out of 5 stars Somehow sound worse than the 2023 edition. Awful connectivity issues,Dusty4341,3,"*This review is for the 2024 version of Raycon Everyday Earbuds. I find it annoying that the reviews for the 2023 version are included here. Most people in their reviews do not differentiate between which set they own, which makes it frustrating to find reviews for the 2024 version. I find this somewhat deceptive on Raycon's part, as it obviously impacts the overall rating. Having said all that:POSITIVES- Earbuds remain firmly in place while sitting- Solid battery life. Really only needed to charge them every two days- Good sound quality for the priceNEGATIVES- An annoying amount of connectivity issues. Earbuds would regularly cut out both during calls and listening to music. In addition, despite my iPhone knowing I own them, oftentimes when taking them out of the case I'll hearing ""pairing mode."" Almost every time this happens, my iPhone does not recognize them, so I have to repeatedly put them back in the case until my phone recognizes the earbuds- Earbuds come with three different sound settings. However, the difference between them is negligible- More often than not, even when I'd put the earbuds back in their case they would still be paired to my iPhone. So, I'd have to go under Bluetooth settings and manually disconnect them- The bass sounds artificial (not true bass), slightly muddy. Personally, I feel the overall sound quality of these is slightly worse than the 2023 version- Regardless of which size earbud tips used, it's like these things are on a personal mission to fall out of my ears. If I go jogging, I'm constantly having to readjust them so they don't fall out. And if I'm doing some light chores around the house, it's the same. While washing some dishes, the left earbud fell out and nearly landed in a bowl of water. Fortunately, I was able to lightly swat it onto the counterAdmittedly, I have high standards when it comes to earbuds due to how often I use them, as well as being a self-professed audiophile. Decided to try these out since my 2023 earbuds are getting older, and quickly realized the 'upgrade' wasn't worth it and will be returning them. To be clear, I've owned WAYY worse earbuds before, and if you can grab these while on sale I wouldn't fault you for it. However, when factoring in all the aforementioned issues, which far outweigh the positives, they simply are not a good option (for me; your results may vary).A week after purchasing these, I decided to splurge on a $180 pair of earbuds from a highly reputable company. I can honestly say I was floored by how much better the sound was; incredible bass that doesn't drown the singing out, excellent treble, and some of the crispest sound I've ever heard.Again, if you're looking for a cheaper option, even with their flaws these aren't terrible earbuds. But for athletic types like me, you can do way better. 3/5, but closer to a 2.5.","Reviewed in the United States February 1, 2024",AGX2MHQWCCATODOEH4DTJ5VPNGUQ,True,12,

RQSTJ5ZXLNF0C,B0CTD6PRBY,4.0 out of 5 stars Great deal.,David Gregory,4,"Updating my last review.My previous pair finally blew out which isn‚Äôt necessarily the products fault. Daily use at work in a loud environment and I‚Äôm a dingus who listens to music too loud.After killing my last pair, I decided to get another set because I did enjoy them, but it appears that Raycon has released a new version of these headphones that have a few things different.All in all they are still great budget headphones which sound good enough, but I think the awareness mode on the new model is worse than the previous, and the biggest issue Ive had with the new ones is the touch to interact. I much preferred the physical button to click in because I keep accidentally activating the controls on the sensitive touch receiver.The last thing they changed which is silly to complain about is that they removed the loop for something to attach to the case like the provided rope keychain. I really enjoyed clipping it into the small clasps in bags so you always know exactly where the case was in your bag when traveling. Not a big deal but I miss it.I am a machinist who is pretty isolated squaring up metal blocks all day. I had some old blu tooth ear buds that were fine but started to lose their charge after years of abuse. I am an Avid music lover, I host a podcast and listen to tons of other podcast and audiobooks, and have a degree in Broadcasting Media. I am constantly listening to things so I have an embarrassing collection of headphones that drives my wife insane. I try to use a cheaper pair of headphones working because I typically have metal chips flying everywhere and the small ear bud headphones always use magnets for keeping the case close and holding it close to the charger. It‚Äôs incredible how easily the razor sharp chips can find their way into a charging case.If I were to compare these raycons to the latest Airpod Pro 2, obviously the AirPods have a higher quality of sound, the transparency mode is significantly better, and there is the ‚Äúfind my‚Äù AirPods app that beeps at you in case you lose your AirPods. But this is comparing a $250 product to a $70 product. I think for the price, quality of sound and features, these headphones are pretty dang hard to beat. And if I‚Äôm completely honest, I think the raycons are more comfortable to me than the airpod pro 2s. The only real complaint I could come up with is stupid, but man the charging case is so small. I know I‚Äôm going to lose these eventually because it‚Äôs so small. But that‚Äôs user error.","Reviewed in the United States March 3, 2023",AE5IUGCPDQOBWMSOGQ5AI5S54JMQ,True,13,

Unfortunately, that's where the positivity ends.The sound quality, to put it mildly, is a letdown. It's a bizarre mix of tinny and muddy, as if the headphones are desperately trying to cover all bases and failing miserably. As an artist with a broad taste in music, these headphones didn't just fall short; they faceplanted.Whether I was diving into the intricate melodies of classical compositions or getting lost in the soulful beats of jazz, the Raycon headphones managed to make each genre sound equally subpar. It's like they have a vendetta against good sound.Now, if your playlist consists solely of top 40 hits and rap music, you might escape the full brunt of the disappointment. However, for anyone who appreciates the nuances of various genres, these headphones are akin to putting a masterpiece through a blender.In conclusion, while the pocket-sized design is nifty, the Raycon headphones are a sonic letdown. They seem tailor-made for the top 40 enthusiasts, but for those seeking a more refined auditory experience across different music genres, the search for the perfect pocket-friendly headphones continues.","Reviewed in the United States February 6, 2024",AHJLJE5P4M56RP2MRHJIT6QD4G7Q,True,7,
RUK1O1KQRBAJE,B0CTD6PRBY,3.0 out of 5 stars Awkward and Uncomfortable,RDomine,3,"I guess I'm going to be in the minority on this one, but I received my earbuds today and two hours later I found myself returning them. I wanted to like them, I really did, but I found a couple of issues that for me were deal-breakers.I'll grant that the sound quality on these buds was pretty darn good. Much better than my previous earbuds. They gave a really nice ability to really hear the separate instruments or vocals in several of the songs I tried them out with. But, honestly, that's about the only thing I found impressive about them.The way these buds are designed to be worn was something I didn't like at all. When stuck into your ears, the bulk of the earbud sits upwards from your ear canal. What it felt like and looked like to me was that I was wearing two blue Miracle Ear hearing aids. They pretty much filled the entire indented area of my ear just like a hearing aid. God knows I don't need something to make me look like I'm a old man, and that fact they were also a nice looking, vivid blue meant I was wearing hearing aids that were shouting down the street ""Hey, look at my blue hearing aids"". Not a look I'm ready to be sporting 'round the hood. It's this same design that brought me to the remaining issues. With the way they're designed to be worn, no matter what silicone piece I tried using to insert them in my ears, it felt as if at any moment they were about to fall out. I'm sure if they would have or not but the feeling that they were right on the precipice was unsettling and distracting. Also, with my previous Apple earbuds, the controls were relatively simple and the buds responded to a simple light tap for various commands. In the case of these buds, they required more than a tap. The center of each earbud isn't so much a touch sensitive item as it's a physical button that has to be pressed in, or held, or pressed multiple times. I found that VERY clunky since it required me pressing it more or less precisely dead center, and the fact the button had to be physically depressed, it meant, for me anyhow, that it would push the earbud out of position a lot of the time and frankly, the list of controls in the manual seemed like learning a naval flag communication language. I would have gotten the hang of it sure, but when commands require three presses of the right ear then hopping on one foot at shouting ""Hit me"" (I'm kidding on that, of course) it just seemed like more hassle than convenience. Lastly, they may look like hearing aids but you'll never go deaf using these. The highest setting for the volume on these seemed disappointingly low to me. I like my music loud I admit, but the max volume I could get out of these left me still able to hear my TV, or a roommate talking. If these things aren't going to let me rock out like I enjoy then that's a deal-breaker right there.So, music quality good, but for me, everything else felt clunky, awkward and uncomfortable, and seriously, who wants to sport sexy electric blue hearing aids all day either? I need something with better comfort, and that I won't need the actual Rosetta Stone to remember the plethora of commands / gestures / modern interpretive dance required to change the volume. Disappointing.","Reviewed in the United States February 16, 2023",AFJLH44GZF6HZS5UKX7H26FOMH6Q,True,46,

R2BPQ8QO7MCXFD,B0CTD6PRBY,5.0 out of 5 stars Perfect Everyday Carry,Ian,5,"The case is small, and has wireless charging. So I just carry it in my pocket, and toss it on to charge every couple days or so. The battery seemingly lasts forever, and I've only had it die once after forgetting to charge it for about a month or so with semi-regular use. The audio quality is also phenomenal for how compact everything is, and pass-through mode is awesome for multitasking. I've already recommended them to several friends and coworkers who have also grown to love them.","Reviewed in the United States July 6, 2024",AH7QIESW6T7YMQLVQZFBPM56W6BA,True,0,
R3QZGG6A2G4DQL,B0CTD6PRBY,5.0 out of 5 stars Great Sound!!,Mike TeeVee,5,"Going through a ton of different pairs of in ear air buds, I finally found the perfect ones! So I have always had trouble finding a pair that doesn't fall out of my ears, of has great sound quality, and if they do stay in, I can never get the volume I like out of them. These immediately, right out of the box, crushed all 3 off my requirements!! They're plenty loud, great quality, and no matter what I do, they stay in my ears!!Price point is more than affordable for what you get!! These are hands down, the best in-ear headphones I've ever used!!","Reviewed in the United States July 4, 2024",AHFY7XEIOV22BV3ODQO6PZ7NBTHA,True,0,

R1AXV1AUOALVLQ,B0CTD6PRBY,3.0 out of 5 stars New revision not an improvement.,Laurance Bennett,3,"I recently purchased the new revision of the everyday earbuds and I have some notes. The pleasant bonk sound when tapping to advance tracks has been replaced with obnoxious high pitched dink sound. Touch controls are barely responsive. Trying to triple tap to move to the next track more often than not results in aforementioned obnoxious sound and pausing, often accompanied with them getting louder. The older style had a actual real button that presses, which doesn't care if you're wearing a glove or have flour on your hands or they're wet, or anything really. These new ones just don't work as well unless your hands are bare and dry but not too dry. The old case had four dots on the front that acted as a battery indicator. New one lacks any obvious indicator. Old case had a lanyard ring built in, new one needs a silicone case for the same function. Overall, the old ones felt like great value for the money, the new ones seem too expensive for what you're getting.","Reviewed in the United States July 15, 2024",AFYW5WZKR6WVBH52EZKO6Z7YEKMA,True,2,
R2VFCL749YR1V0,B0CTD6PRBY,3.0 out of 5 stars Decent but not good enough.,Morbidelf,3,"Bluetooth connection was OK, kinda a bit of a walk through. Not having wireless charge is kinda lame but not a deal breaker. Sound was decent but not as good as my Galaxy Pro2 pods. I mainly got for the noise cancelation and transparency mode. It works well but there is definitely more functionality with the Galaxy Pro2 pods. Volume control is decent and they are cute. The size is convenient. The buds are a little awkward for smaller ears but doable. They are uncomfortable to lay on imo, which is a deal breaker for me. The magnetics in the case and buds are good also. They are over all good for value but I needed something with better noise canceling and sound quality.","Reviewed in the United States August 25, 2024",AFGNVWUZJ7GSAQ4RVB54KM6NGYVA,True,0,Color: Forrest Green
