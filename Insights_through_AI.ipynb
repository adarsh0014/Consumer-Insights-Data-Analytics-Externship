            "* **Pivot Selection:**  The code selects the middle element as the pivot. While this isn't the most sophisticated pivot selection strategy, it generally performs well. \n",
            "* **Partitioning:** The array is partitioned into three subarrays: elements less than the pivot, elements equal to the pivot, and elements greater than the pivot.\n",
            "* **Recursive Sorting:** Quicksort is applied recursively to the left and right subarrays until the entire array is sorted.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Why Quicksort is Efficient:**\n",
            "\n",
            "* **In-Place Sorting:** Quicksort modifies the original array directly, reducing memory overhead.\n",
            "* **Average Case Performance:** It has an average time complexity of O(n log n), which is very efficient for large datasets.\n",
            "* **Adaptability:** Quicksort can be modified to handle different pivot selection strategies and partitioning techniques for improved performance in specific scenarios.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Note:** While Quicksort is generally very efficient, it's important to note that its worst-case time complexity is O(n^2). This occurs when the pivot selection repeatedly results in unbalanced partitions. \n",
